Giving employment and status to thousands of largely illiterate villagers from Mumbai's hinterland, this co-operative has been in operation since the late nineteenth century. It provides one of the most efficient delivery networks in the world: only one lunch in six million goes astray.  The Harvard Business School has used this venture as a case-history of a cooperative since 2009.\r\n\r\nTranslated from the original Italian edition, Sara Roncaglia’s ethnographic description of the Mumbaite system reveals that, in contrast with more sophisticated market cultures, the order of affections and food containers maintains its tenacious hierarchy of precedence, which is as much about ethics as it is about taste and aesthetics.\r\n\r\ndeeply rooted in the nutritional bond between family and work, men and women, etiquette and bodily ritual, and community membership. \r\n\r\nUniquely born of Mumbai's mix of religions -- Hindu, Parsi, Christian, Jewish, Muslim -- as well as many languages and ethnic regions -- this cuisine is also the result of several cross-cultural marriages between Europeans and Indians.  The sheer simplicity of the idea—a service for transporting food prepared at home by the family to a customer’s place of work—underlies an entrepreneurial strategy based on the ability to exploit the interaction with Mumbai’s complex ethnic and social configuration.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781909254039","urn:ISBN:9781909254022","urn:ISBN:9781909254046","urn:ISBN:9781909254008","urn:ISBN:9781909254015"],"id":117697,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/e2/55/e255a5be77117dd4c6032d005627ecbe.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/986/?feed=opds","author":"Sara Roncaglia","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","Science Fiction"],"updated":"2015-02-26T14:11:20","language":"en","title":"Zero Sum Game","issued":"2014","summary":"<div>\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<em><strong>Deadly.

Its plot ostensibly concerns Gulf War Syndrome, a mysterious ailment reported by veterans of the first Gulf War (1991).  It's set in the early-to-mid 1990's but presages many developments that are just now appearing in the real world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Careful readers may notice that this is the same description that I used for <em>Acts of the Apostles</em>, about which more below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As American-led forces assemble in Saudi Arabia for the largest military operation since Normandy, computer designer Todd Griffith discovers a secret function buried within the Kali chip. That night he is shot in the head. Five years later, burnt-out Silicon Valley software engineer Nick Aubrey boards a &quot;red-eye&quot; flight to Boston and winds up seated next to a very disturbed man who claims to know the secret of Gulf War Syndrome. Over Utah, Nick's chance companion meets his dramatic demise, and the police accuse Nick of murder. Soon the police are the least of Nick's worries. On the run from a Silicon Valley tech messiah and the hacker cult that venerates him, tempted by exotic foreign beauties, betrayed by those closest to him, Nick must solve the Gulf War enigma or spend the rest of his life on the lam. The only person who doesn't want a piece of Nick, it seems, is his estranged wife Bartlett, a genetic scientist with secrets of her own.  All clues lead to a pharmaceutical laboratory in Basel Switzerland, where scientists are working on submicrosopic machines to rearrange human DNA. But Nick can't find out what's really going on without Todd's help, and Todd's been in a coma for nearly half a dozen years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Careful readers may notice that this is nearly identical to the synopsis of <em>Acts of the Apostles</em>. What gives?</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Biodigital </strong></em>and<strong> <em>Acts of the Apostles</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The novel<em> Biodigital</em> is a half-new novel largely based on <em>Acts of the Apostles</em>. To a rough approximation, the texts of <em>Acts</em> and <em>Biodigital </em>are about 60% congruent. Each book also contains another 40% of material that is not in the other. So they're the same but different, kinda like different versions of Superman or Batman &quot;origin&quot; movies, or the original (John Wayne) and remake (Jeff Bridges) versions of <em>True Grit.  </em>Or maybe like the 1858 and 1867 editions of <em>Leaves of Grass.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Got it. But What's the Difference Between the Books and Which One Should I Read?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Acts of the Apostles </em>is a more convoluted book than <em>Biodigital</em> is. Its plot has curlicues and diversions and intricacies and improbabilities. Depending on your tastes, this is either a bug or a feature. (In my opinion, it's a little of both). <em>Biodigital</em> is more straight ahead, more of a pure thriller, more Dan Brown than Neil Stephenson, which in some ways makes it a less sophisticated book. But on the other hand, the roles of four characters, most signicantly Nick's wife Bartlett, are substantially enhanced in <em>Biodigital</em>. And as a consequence, the actions of the main villain are also seen to be much less arbitrary than they are in <em>Acts,</em> and hence even more sinister. Plus, I've rewritten the opening chapters to make them more logical and faster paced than their counterparts in <em>Acts. </em>And significantly, because Bartlett is on stage much more in <em>Biodigital </em>than she was in <em>Acts</em>, so too is her science. I think the overall verisimilitude is enhanced, given recent real-world developments in brain and genetic sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One more point: <em>Acts of the Apostles</em> is part of the <em>Mind over Matter</em> trilogy, which also includes <em>Cheap Complex Devices</em> and <em>The Pains</em>. But most of the parts of <em>Acts</em> that hook into these other two books are not present in <em>Biodigital</em>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This is so fascinating! Give Me the Gory Backstory of How You Decided to Remake Your Classic <em>&quot;Acts&quot;</em>! </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here's how <em>Biodigital</em> came about. About four years ago I sold the rights to Acts of the Apostles, my 1999 self-published novel that has acquired a modest but passionate fan base, to a small publishing house (call it &quot;U&quot;) whose titles I much esteemed. The terms of the deall were that some &quot;small edits&quot; might be required before the book could be published; the editorial director (&quot;V&quot;) would direct me. As the process of &quot;cleaning up&quot; the book began, it became clear that V had in mind a book substantially different from <em>Acts</em>. Although the main plot and most of the characters were the same, some sub-plots and characters were to deleted, some characters changed names and/or took on greater or lesser roles than in the original book. It was pretty much a wholesale overhaul. I did it because I wanted to see how the book would do with a &quot;real&quot; publisher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although many of the changes sought (or demanded) by V were clearly improvements, as time wore on the process became less and less fun. Every change I made gave rise to new demands for ever more revisions. Although my editor had some good editorial instincts, V and I simply had very different conceptions of what the book was about.  Among other things, at V's direction I deleted most of the &quot;hooks&quot; that connected <em>Acts </em>with the other two books in the <em>Mind over Matter </em>trilogy.<em> </em>At some point we decided that the book was different enough from the original <em>Acts of the Apostles</em> to deserve a new name. I christened it Biodigital. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, after I had spent a year revising <em>Acts</em> / creating <em>Biodigital</em>, U and V finally declared that they were finally happy with it. But, to my dismay, they then said that they weren't going to publish it (I supsect that their money was running low, but I don't really know).  In any event,  the rights reverted to me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I put the book in my virtual sock drawer for more than two years, not sure if I liked it well enough to go to the trouble of publishing something that might only confuse or annoy people who had already read <em>Acts.</em> On the other hand there was a lot to like about it. So, I decided to spend a little while undoing the enforced changes that I least liked and throw it out to the world to see how it did.

However, along with this technological democratization comes a paradoxical flipside: the norms regulating culture's use - copyright and related rights - have become increasingly restrictive.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis book brings together essays by academics, librarians, entrepreneurs, activists and policy makers, who were all part of the EU-funded <a href=\"http://www.communia-association.org/\">Communia</a> project.

I remember the feeling, being completely and utterly captivated, inspired, chills running down my spine. I also remember turning around to look at my father to see him practically naked and scratching his balls. Star Destroyers, light sabers, the Force, my hairy father drooling on the sofa... subconsciously, something clicked. No longer would I be content with “normal” middle class existence. I would, I told myself, seek adventure, do something amazing, and someday walk among the stars.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe next day in my backyard, I was playing Jedi with a baseball bat and it flung out of my hands to come to a rest in the grass. I closed my eyes and stretched out my hand, trying to feel the Force, really wanting to believe in some <em>magical power</em> that Jesus might grant me. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the bat didn’t move.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt was like finding out Santa Claus wasn’t real; another conformation of the fact that this world was a sad, boring, non-magical place: a world of insurance agents rather than Jedi. I cried, having witnessed the danger of impossible expectations that could never be satisfied.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere’s sometimes this weird contrast in our lives—the difference felt between the real world and the screen world, the world of stories. Real life isn't like a fantasy, or advertisements. One of the key ideas behind Neal Gabler's book Life the Movie is how we increasingly understand our lives in terms of media. He writes, 'what the movies provided... was a tangible model to which one could conform life and a standard against one could measure it... Why can’t life be more like the movies? Viewers asked, and then answered that it could.'⁠</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut 9 times out of 10, when I shave with a Gillette razor beautiful women don’t come into the room wrapped in towels and eager to touch my face.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt seems silly to even write that, but media has power. What would you think about if your non-pornstar imperfect partner doesn't scream orgasmically during your awkward sex?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWould it be surprising given the thousands of advertisements that surround us each day that we are constantly thinking of sexual partners in terms of products? </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCan't we just throw away relationships like we do a two-year-old iPhone? </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWon't something new and better come along for us to consume?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIsn't this how we consume pornography? Oscillating between stimulation and boredom, moving on to the next thing, building a tolerance. We consume it, and it does something to us.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat is this ever-increasing on-rush of images doing to us?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe future of romance is filled with more difficult questions than answers. Answers that can only be answered on a person by person basis. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt’s been wonderful hearing the variety of responses and interpretations I’ve gotten regarding 23rd Century Romance. This pleases me very much, as I have gone to great lengths to preserve a certain sense of moral ambiguity about everything in the book. Even the sparse detail was a style choice that makes for a quick read where you can shape the characters in your mind how you will. The point of it all is that your interpretation matters.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUse your imagination.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHumans lives have changed radically in the last 50 years, especially in comparison to what they looked like for most of the thousand years we have been a species. Technology is throwing us into new environments and situations the human race has never encountered before, and we must deal with the questions and challenges as they are presented to us. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs a science fiction writer, my goal is to write stories that help us think about the future. In dealing with the rise of the Virtual, we need to ask intelligent questions about what the proliferation of screens might be doing to us. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI have my own take, but I’ll wait until after more people have read the story until I reveal my thoughts on the story. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut on a general level, for me, 23rd Century Romance is about the dangers of falling in love with the idea of something we can never really have. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThus concludes my thoughts.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe &quot;Campaign&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tReading the book is payment enough for me, but I would also greatly appreciate donations, not only to help me break even on 23rd Century Romance but to help raise enough money to spend more time working on my upcoming non-fiction book: How to become a better Christian by becoming an Atheist (and visa versa).</p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781492134237"],"id":130413,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/88/5a/885a8598ef1ee85c95638d86fbacab70.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1134/?feed=opds","author":"Jake Hartnell","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","Nonfiction","Science Fiction"],"updated":"2014-11-21T00:19:35","language":"en","title":"The Rapture of the Nerds","issued":"2012-2013","summary":"Welcome to the fractured future, at the dusk of the twenty-first century.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nEarth has a population of roughly a billion hominids.

But then he remembers the mysterious Visitor and the perilous mission that took Frances from him, and darkness closes in again. Even so, there’s always the hope that this time will be different, that they will have found a way. It was always like this. Hope would always rise again, no matter how often it was struck down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How it happened</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Green Comet began in 1994. It also began before then and after then. I’m sure most books are the same. They’re impossible to pin down to a specific date, depending on what you use for criteria.

I wonder if it was a coincidence that the movies Armageddon and Deep Impact appeared in 1998. Probably.-)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea began simmering in my mind, and I even wrote a couple of short stories to explore the concept of living on comets, but it was mostly conceptual until about 2004. I decided then to think about it seriously. Since I had a menial job at the time I could spend the whole day thinking about it, and jot down notes after work. I knew I had a story when Elgin and Frances showed up. In 2009 I finished with that job and that’s when I put pen to paper with the aim of getting the story written. Three years later it was ready to publish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Publishing meant learning how to convert the story to ebook formats, making sure that they were presentable, and adding pictures when I learned that people expect ebooks to have “covers.” Then there was the matter of recording, editing and packaging the audio book. A whole new set of skills. Finally I had to learn how to create and manage a website, so Green Comet would have a place to live on the Internet. Fortunately I enjoy learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you have as much fun reading Green Comet as I had writing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>rjb</p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780991953202","urn:ISBN:9780991953219"],"id":128673,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/fa/15/fa15770ef006e6d4ada05e076da4e788.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2318/?feed=opds","author":"Jim Bowering","isOwn":false},{"category":["Computer programming","Computers","lisp","LISP (Computer program language)","LISP (Langage de programmation)","Nonfiction","Programmation (Informatique)","Programmeren (computers)","Programmierung","Programming","Protected DAISY"],"updated":"2015-01-13T14:28:54","language":"en","title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd Edition","issued":"1979-1996","summary":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past decade.

I recommend it to you for its breadth and insight.</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t— Charles E. May, 29 April 2014, review available on Prof. May's blog, at <a href=\"http://may-on-the-short-story.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/florence-goyet-classic-short-story-1870.html\">http://may-on-the-short-story.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/florence-goyet-classic-short-story-1870.html</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Florence Goyet's book is remarkable as much for the scope of its corpus (more than a thousand stories in five languages) as for the quality of its analysis. The author defines the short story first by examining its narrative strategies, then by focusing on its print circulation and finally on how the text shapes its own reading. Goyet refines the distinctive features ordinarily accepted by the critics; she then shows that the readers of short stories are always different from the characters depicted, through the specific periodicals in which they are published. This is why the &quot;peasant” stories of Maupassant appear in high society periodicals, and why the &quot;European” stories of Henry James are published in the US, whereas his &quot;American” ones are accepted in English magazines. The primary aim of the genre is to emphasize the picturesqueness of subjects which are a familiar sight for the readers yet in reality strange, because the characters live in another world altogether. Close analysis of this context in which the stories are published leads Goyet to define the genre as &quot;monological” — being at odds with polyphony — a thesis which is confirmed in her subsequent analyses of the stylistic procedures that discredit the characters. Thus, this book provides us with a new understanding of the short text, which is all the more convincing in that it is always rigorously supported by probing theoretical discussions and by precise textual analyses.</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t— Denis Pernot, <em>Revue d'Histoire Littéraire de la France</em>,  XCV/1 (Janvier-Fevrier 1995), p. 127</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe ability to construct a nuanced narrative or complex character in the constrained form of the short story has sometimes been seen as the ultimate test of an author's creativity. Yet during the time when the short story was at its most popular - the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries - even the greatest writers followed strict generic conventions that were far from subtle.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis expanded and updated translation of Florence Goyet's influential <em>La Nouvelle, 1870-1925: Description d'un genre à son apogée</em> (Paris, 1993) is the only study to focus exclusively on this classic period across different continents. Ranging through French, English, Italian, Russian and Japanese writing - particularly the stories of Guy de Maupassant, Henry James, Giovanni Verga, Anton Chekhov and Akutagawa Rūnosuke - Goyet shows that these authors were able to create brilliant and successful short stories using the very simple 'tools of brevity' of that period.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this challenging and far-reaching study, Goyet looks at classic short stories in the context in which they were read at the time: cheap newspapers and higher-end periodicals. She demonstrates that, despite the apparent intention of these stories to question bourgeois ideals, they mostly affirmed the prejudices of their readers. In doing so, her book forces us to rethink our preconceptions about this 'forgotten' genre.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Open Book Publishers - Setting Knowledge Free</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt Open Book Publishers we believe that knowledge is for sharing.

The story was originally serialized in Analog magazine. Background Ten thousand refugees from the losing side of The Big War (The System States War of The Cosmic Computer) fled far beyond the boundaries of the Terran Federation and colonized the planet Excalibur. By the beginning of Space Viking, they had expanded to a handful of Sword Worlds (so-called because they are named after legendary swords) and had grown to a total population of three and a half billion, organized in a feudal system of kingdoms, duchies, and other small states, ruled by frequently-warring noblemen. Despite their isolation and the political instability, the inhabitants managed to retain a high level of technology, including space flight. One day, a starship rediscovered the Old Federation. Civilization had collapsed, presumably due to the war; many of the planets had regressed to varying stages of semi-barbarism. Taking advantage of the situation, &quot;Space Vikings&quot; (reminiscent of Norse vikings) proceeded to raid the poorly defended Federation worlds over the next three hundred years for loot.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780441777846","urn:ISBN:9780441777792","urn:ISBN:9780843960716","urn:ISBN:9780441602254","urn:ISBN:9780722168769","urn:ISBN:9780824014278","urn:ISBN:9781434400567","urn:ISBN:9780937912102","urn:ISBN:9780554369389"],"id":67286,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=j6NrcDkA2wYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2704/?feed=opds","author":"H.

Workers in special economic zones are trapped in lives of poverty with no trade unions to represent their rights. But a group of teenagers from across the world are set to fight this injustice using the most surprising of tools - their online video games. In Industrial South China Matthew and his friends labour day and night as gold-farmers, amassing virtual wealth that's sold on to rich Western players, while in the slums of Mumbai 'General Robotwallah' Mala marshalls her team of online thugs on behalf of the local gang-boss, who in turn works for the game-owners. They're all being exploited, as their friend Wei-Dong, all the way over in LA, knows, but can do little about. Until they begin to realize that their similarities outweigh their differences, and agree to work together to claim their rights to fair working conditions. Under the noses of the ruling elites in China and the rest of Asia, they fight their bosses, the owners of the games and rich speculators, outsmarting them all with their unbeatable gaming skills. But soon the battle will spill over from the virtual world to the real one, leaving Mala, Matthew and even Wei-Dong fighting not just for their rights, but for their lives.<br /><br />\r\nepub and kindle files for this edition include a new cover, table of contents, and numerous corrections contributed at <a href=\"http://craphound.com/ftw/download/\">Craphound.com</a>","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780007352012","urn:ISBN:9780765322166","urn:ISBN:9780007291182","urn:ISBN:9780007362110","urn:ISBN:9780765333841","urn:ISBN:9789635251827"],"id":52940,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2792/?feed=opds","author":"Cory Doctorow","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","Science Fiction"],"updated":"2014-12-12T13:00:31","language":"en","title":"Hunter","issued":"2011","summary":"Hunter is a short Sci-Fi story set in a dark and desperate world.","id":140873,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2529/?feed=opds","author":"Wil Wheaton","isOwn":false},{"category":["Computer games","Electronic games","Nonfiction","Open source software","Python (Computer program language)"],"updated":"2015-05-14T13:08:10","language":"en","title":"Making Games with Python and Pygame","issued":"2010","summary":"Making Games with Python &amp; Pygame covers the Pygame library with the source code for 11 games.

Ishmael narrates the monomaniacal quest of Ahab, captain of the whaler Pequod, for revenge on Moby Dick, a white whale which on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. Although the novel was a commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, its reputation as a Great American Novel grew during the twentieth century. William Faulkner confessed he wished he had written it himself, and D. H. Lawrence called it &quot;one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world&quot;, and &quot;the greatest book of the sea ever written&quot;. &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; is one of world literature's most famous opening sentences.\r\nThe product of a year and a half of writing, the book is dedicated to Nathaniel Hawthorne, &quot;in token of my admiration for his genius&quot;, and draws on Melville's experience at sea, on his reading in whaling literature, and on literary inspirations such as Shakespeare and the Bible. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies and asides.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere were slight but important differences between the texts of the London edition, which appeared first, and the New York edition. The London publisher cut or changed sensitive passages and Melville made changes as well, including a last-minute change in the title. The work first appeared as The Whale in London in October 1851 and then under its definitive title Moby-Dick in New York in November. The whale, however, appears in both the London and New York editions as &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, with no hyphen. The British edition was not reprinted, while the American edition was reprinted three times, the last time in 1871. Only 3,200 copies were sold during the author's life.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nVersions built by GITenberg are available here.

One of America’s most original and influential public intellectuals, his focus is the social dimension of creativity: how creative work builds on the past and how society encourages or inhibits that building with laws and technologies. In his two previous books, CODE and THE FUTURE OF IDEAS, Lessig concentrated on the destruction of much of the original promise of the Internet. Now, in FREE CULTURE, he widens his focus to consider the diminishment of the larger public domain of ideas. In this powerful wake-up call he shows how short-sighted interests blind to the long-term damage they’re inflicting are poisoning the ecosystem that fosters innovation.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAll creative works—books, movies, records, software, and so on—are a compromise between what can be imagined and what is possible—technologically and legally.  For more than two hundred years, laws in America have sought a balance between rewarding creativity and allowing the borrowing from which new creativity springs.  The original term of copyright set by the First Congress in 1790 was 14 years, renewable once. Now it is closer to two hundred. Thomas Jefferson considered protecting the public against overly long monopolies on creative works an essential government role.  What did he know that we’ve forgotten?\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLawrence Lessig shows us that while new technologies always lead to new laws, never before have the big cultural monopolists used the fear created by new technologies, specifically the Internet, to shrink the public domain of ideas, even as the same corporations use the same technologies to control more and more what we can and can’t do with culture. As more and more culture becomes digitized, more and more becomes controllable, even as laws are being toughened at the behest of the big media groups. What’s at stake is our freedom—freedom to create, freedom to build, and ultimately, freedom to imagine.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nPurchase links benefitting Creative Commons and Public Knowledge are available <a href=\"http://www.free-culture.cc/get-it/\">on the author's website</a>.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780143034650","urn:ISBN:9781594200069","urn:ISBN:9781594200465","urn:ISBN:9781435292161"],"id":9807,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=1hs1GWwnx-wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2749/?feed=opds","author":"Lawrence Lessig","isOwn":false},{"category":["Computer programming","Cryptography","Nonfiction","Python (Computer program language)"],"updated":"2015-06-25T12:42:49","language":"en","title":"Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python","issued":"2013","summary":"Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python teaches complete beginners how to program in the Python programming language.

In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it sufficiently unobscene to allow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce's &quot;cloacal obsession.&quot; None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains the modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, Ulysses is also a compulsively readable book. Even the verbal vaudeville of the final chapters can be navigated with relative ease, as long as you're willing to be buffeted, tickled, challenged, and (occasionally) vexed by Joyce's sheer command of the English language.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780679722762","urn:ISBN:9781587262852","urn:ISBN:9780141182803","urn:ISBN:9780394743127","urn:ISBN:9781404336872","urn:ISBN:9780679600114","urn:ISBN:9780192834645","urn:ISBN:9780199535675","urn:ISBN:9781936041725"],"id":66719,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=GRgBOYqR_G4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4510/?feed=opds","author":"James Joyce","isOwn":false},{"category":["Corrupt practices","Ethics","History","Lobbying","Nonfiction","Political corruption","Politics and government","United States","United States.

Federal Election Commission-trust in our government has reached an all-time low. More than ever before, Americans believe that money buys results in Congress, and that business interests wield control over our legislature.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWith heartfelt urgency and a keen desire for righting wrongs, Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig takes a clear-eyed look at how we arrived at this crisis: how fundamentally good people, with good intentions, have allowed our democracy to be co-opted by outside interests, and how this exploitation has become entrenched in the system. Rejecting simple labels and reductive logic-and instead using examples that resonate as powerfully on the Right as on the Left-Lessig seeks out the root causes of our situation. He plumbs the issues of campaign financing and corporate lobbying, revealing the human faces and follies that have allowed corruption to take such a foothold in our system. He puts the issues in terms that nonwonks can understand, using real-world analogies and real human stories. And ultimately he calls for widespread mobilization and a new Constitutional Convention, presenting achievable solutions for regaining control of our corrupted-but redeemable-representational system. In this way, Lessig plots a roadmap for returning our republic to its intended greatness. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhile America may be divided, Lessig vividly champions the idea that we can succeed if we accept that corruption is our common enemy and that we must find a way to fight against it. In REPUBLIC, LOST, he not only makes this need palpable and clear-he gives us the practical and intellectual tools to do something about it.\r\n<br /><br />Purchase hard cover from <a href=\"http://twelvebooks.com/catalog/this-season-spring-2012/republic-lost/\">Twelve Books</a>.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780446576437","urn:ISBN:9780446576420"],"id":130416,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=pOd9J3vvWhkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1122/?feed=opds","author":"Lawrence Lessig","isOwn":false},{"category":["Eschatology","Fantasy","Fiction"],"publishers":[{"publisher":"Restless Brain Media"}],"updated":"2014-07-20T23:15:48","language":"en","title":"Earth - The Afterlife Series III","issued":"2011","summary":"<p>\r\n\tThanks for checking out my award-nominated novella!

One of the questions many people raise is, “why go through all the hassle of manually building a Linux system from scratch when you can just download and install an existing one?”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOne important reason for this project's existence is to help you learn how a Linux system works from the inside out. Building an LFS system helps demonstrate what makes Linux tick, and how things work together and depend on each other. One of the best things that this learning experience can provide is the ability to customize a Linux system to suit your own unique needs.<br /><br />\r\nAnother key benefit of LFS is that it allows you to have more control over the system without relying on someone else's Linux implementation. With LFS, you are in the driver's seat and dictate every aspect of the system.<br /><br />\r\nLFS allows you to create very compact Linux systems. When installing regular distributions, you are often forced to install a great many programs which are probably never used or understood. These programs waste resources. You may argue that with today's hard drive and CPUs, such resources are no longer a consideration. Sometimes, however, you are still constrained by size considerations if nothing else. Think about bootable CDs, USB sticks, and embedded systems. Those are areas where LFS can be beneficial.<br /><br />\r\nAnother advantage of a custom built Linux system is security. By compiling the entire system from source code, you are empowered to audit everything and apply all the security patches desired. It is no longer necessary to wait for somebody else to compile binary packages that fix a security hole. Unless you examine the patch and implement it yourself, you have no guarantee that the new binary package was built correctly and adequately fixes the problem.\r\nThe goal of Linux From Scratch is to build a complete and usable foundation-level system. If you do not wish to build your own Linux system from scratch, you may not entirely benefit from the information in this book.<br /><br />\r\nThere are too many other good reasons to build your own LFS system to list them all here. In the end, education is by far the most powerful of reasons. As you continue in your LFS experience, you will discover the power that information and knowledge truly bring.<br /><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/contribute.html\">Donate or contribute</a> to the LFS Project.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781300019831","urn:ISBN:9780595137657","urn:ISBN:9780965957564","urn:ISBN:9780965957571"],"id":151345,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/d2/67/d267da87acb5f8ebfe35859a61a05273.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3030/?feed=opds","author":"Gerard Beekmans","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","Fiction / Science Fiction","Science Fiction","Social ecology"],"updated":"2015-10-25T14:01:28","language":"en","title":"Burn","issued":"2005-2015","summary":"<p>\r\n\tColonization is the theme of this exciting, complex page-turner that provides a provocative and entertaining look at Thoreau's classic eco-text Walden.

G. Wells's classic novel The Time Machine, first published in 1895, is one part fairy tale, one part love story, one part science fiction, and one part utopia. Readers can enjoy the story on multiple levels and take away something unique to themselves upon finishing the novel. With every turn of the page, we become as little children being read a good night story; for in effect, we are being read to rather than reading ourselves. The story is told through an unnamed narrator, a young member of an informal group of men who meet occasionally at the Time Traveler's house for dinner, drinks, cigars, and conversation. It is no accident that the narrator who tells us the story is the least skeptical, indeed the most credulous of the group, in response to the Time Traveler's claim to have built a Time Machine. We need an optimistic and trusting narrator, for he represents the audacity of hope, the possibility of human endeavor leading to improvement and progress, at a time when the specter of social Darwinism and scientific fatalism had fallen over the western world. The narrator is the one who exclaims, in response to the prospect of traveling into the future, &quot;To discover a society erected on a strictly communistic basis.&quot; As humorous and naive as such a statement sounds to us today, communism was a synonym for utopia in the late nineteenth century. And so we are supposed to identify with the narrator, to suspend our disbelief in the absurd hypothesis of time as the fourth dimension and the fantastical invention of a time machine. During the time when we submit to the power of the story and allow ourselves to be swept away by the fantasy, time machine does exist and time travel is possible.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780451528551","urn:ISBN:9780553213515","urn:ISBN:9780141439976","urn:ISBN:9780812505047","urn:ISBN:9780486284729","urn:ISBN:9781936594115","urn:ISBN:9780441802630","urn:ISBN:9780439436540","urn:ISBN:9780893753450"],"id":53319,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=QheiKTNdrQoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4816/?feed=opds","author":"H.

Commonly named among the Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular English, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry &quot;Huck&quot; Finn, a friend of Tom Sawyer and narrator of two other Twain novels (Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective). It is a direct sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.<br /><br />\r\nThe book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in a Southern antebellum society that had ceased to exist about twenty years before the work was published, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an often scathing satire on entrenched attitudes, particularly racism.\r\n<br /><br />The versions at Internet Archive include the 174 Illustrations by E.

Some say it has gone. What was responsible for its birth? Who is responsible for its demise?&quot; &quot;In The Future of Ideas, Lawrence Lessig explains how the Internet revolution has produced a counterrevolution of devastating power and effect. The explosion of innovation we have seen in the environment of the Internet was not conjured from some new, previously unimagined technological magic; instead, it came from an ideal as old as the nation. Creativity flourished there because the Internet protected an innovation commons. The Internet's very design built a neutral platform upon which the widest range of creators could experiment. The legal architecture surrounding it protected this free space so that culture and information - the ideas of our era - could flow freely and inspire an unprecedented breadth of expression. But this structural design is changing - both legally and technically.&quot; &quot;This shift will destroy the opportunities for creativity and innovation that the Internet originally engendered. The cultural dinosaurs of our recent past are moving to quickly remake cyberspace so that they can better protect their interests against the future. Powerful forces are swiftly using both law and technology to &quot;tame&quot; the internet, transforming it from an open forum for ideas into nothing more than cable television on speed. Innovation, once again, will be directed from the top down, increasingly controlled by owners of the networks, holders of the largest patent portfolios, and, most invidiously, hoarders of copyrights.&quot;--BOOK JACKET.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780375726446","urn:ISBN:9780375505782"],"id":32477,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=JDOQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2774/?feed=opds","author":"Lawrence Lessig","isOwn":false},{"category":{"term":"18-","scheme":"http://schema.org/typicalAgeRange","label":"Adult/Advanced Reader"},"updated":"2016-10-12T00:01:12","language":"en","title":"Unix as IDE","issued":"2012","summary":"<p>Newbies and experienced professional programmers alike appreciate the concept of the IDE, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\">integrated development environment</a>.

Published in folio form seven years after the playwright's death by Isaac Iaggard and Edward Blount, and overseen by Shakespeare's fellow actors John Heminge and Henry Condell, the First Folio contains the text of thirty-six plays, half of which had not been previously published during the Bard's lifetime. At last, readers had the plays as they were actually performed, &quot;where before,&quot; the editors wrote, &quot;you were abused with diverse, stolen and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by the frauds and stealths of injurious imposters. . . .&quot; Sold for one pound each at the time, this remarkable collection is invaluable to our understanding of the playwright and our conception of his canon. The British Library and the Globe Theatre in London have worked together to produce a series of affordable and beautifully reproduced facsimile editions of three individual plays from the book, A Midsummer Night's Dream, King Lear, and Romeo and Juliet. In addition to the text for each play, each title will include copies of the preliminary pages from the Folio-including the famous engraved portrait of Shakespeare by Martin Droeshout and an introduction to each individual work by Anthony James West.

With the unwitting help of its users, the generative Internet is on a path to a lockdown, ending its cycle of innovation—and facilitating unsettling new kinds of control.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIPods, iPhones, Xboxes, and TiVos represent the first wave of Internet-centered products that can’t be easily modified by anyone except their vendors or selected partners. These “tethered appliances” have already been used in remarkable but little-known ways: car GPS systems have been reconfigured at the demand of law enforcement to eavesdrop on the occupants at all times, and digital video recorders have been ordered to self-destruct thanks to a lawsuit against the manufacturer thousands of miles away. New Web 2.0 platforms like Google mash-ups and Facebook are rightly touted—but their applications can be similarly monitored and eliminated from a central source. As tethered appliances and applications eclipse the PC, the very nature of the Internet—its “generativity,” or innovative character—is at risk.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe Internet’s current trajectory is one of lost opportunity. Its salvation, Zittrain argues, lies in the hands of its millions of users.

Many authors chose to write a textbook because there are no textbooks in their field or because they are not satisfied with the existing textbooks. This frustration has produced several excellent textbooks in the networking community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe frustrations that motivated this book are different. When the main author started to teach networking in the late 1990s, students were already Internet users, but their usage was limited. Students were still using reference textbooks and spent time in the library. Today’s students are completely different. They are avid and experimented web users who find lots of information on the web. This is a positive attitude since they are probably more curious than their predecessors. Thanks to the information that is available on the Internet, they can check or obtain additional information about the topics explained by their teachers. This abundant information creates several challenges for a teacher. Until the end of the nineteenth century, a teacher was by definition more knowledgeable than his students and it was very difficult for the students to verify the lessons given by their teachers. Today, given the amount of information available at the fingertips of each student through the Internet, verifying a lesson or getting more information about a given topic is sometimes only a few clicks away. Websites such as wikipedia provide lots of information on various topics and students often consult them. Unfortunately, the organisation of the information on these websites is not well suited to allow students to learn from them. Furthermore, there are huge differences in the quality and depth of the information that is available for different topics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second reason is that the computer networking community is a strong participant in the open-source movement. Today, there are high-quality and widely used open-source implementations for most networking protocols. This includes the TCP/IP implementations that are part of linux, freebsd or the uIP stack running on 8bits controllers, but also servers such as bind, unbound, apache or sendmail and implementations of routing protocols such as xorp or quagga. Furthermore, the documents that define almost all of the Internet protocols have been developed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) using an open process. The IETF publishes its protocol specifications in the publicly available RFC and new proposals are described in Internet drafts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis open textbook aims to fill the gap between the open-source implementations and the open-source network specifications by providing a detailed but pedagogical description of the key principles that guide the operation of the Internet. The book is released under a creative commons licence. Such an open-source license is motivated by two reasons. The first is that we hope that this will allow many students to use the book to learn computer networks. The second is that I hope that other teachers will reuse, adapt and improve it. Time will tell if it is possible to build a community of contributors to improve and develop the book further. As a starting point, the first release contains all the material for a one-semester first upper undergraduate or a graduate networking course.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe current HTML version of the book is at <a href=\"http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/1st/html/index.html\">http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/1st/html/index.html</a>.

It describes the permeation of economic, political, and social contexts by game-elements such as awards, rule structures, and interfaces that are inspired by video games. Sometimes the term is reduced to the implementation of points, badges, and leaderboards as incentives and motivations to be productive. Sometimes it is envisioned as a universal remedy to deeply transform society toward more humane and playful ends. Despite its use by corporations to manage brand communities and personnel, however, gamification is more than just a marketing buzzword. States are beginning to use it as a new tool for governing populations more effectively. It promises to fix what is wrong with reality by making every single one of us fitter, happier, and healthier. Indeed, it seems like all of society is up for being transformed into one massive game.<br /><br />\r\nThe contributions in this book offer a candid assessment of the gamification hype. They trace back the historical roots of the phenomenon and explore novel design practices and methods. They critically discuss its social implications and even present artistic tactics for resistance.

We'll use the world's most popular functional programming language: JavaScript. Some may feel this is a poor choice as it's against the grain of the current culture which, at the moment, feels predominately imperative. However, I believe it is the best way to learn FP for several reasons:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t<strong>You likely use it every day at work.</strong></p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tThis makes it possible to practice and apply your acquired knowledge each day on real world programs rather than pet projects on nights and weekends in an esoteric FP language.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t<strong>We don't have to learn everything up front to start writing programs.</strong></p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tIn a pure functional language, you cannot log a variable or read a DOM node without using monads. Here we can cheat a little as we learn to purify our codebase. It's also easier to get started in this language since it's mixed paradigm and you can fall back on your current practices while there are gaps in your knowledge.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t<strong>The language is fully capable of writing top notch functional code.</strong></p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tWe have all the features we need to mimic a language like Scala or Haskell with the help of a tiny library or two. Object-oriented programming currently dominates the industry, but it's clearly awkward in JavaScript. It's akin to camping off of a highway or tap dancing in galoshes. We have to <code>bind</code> all over the place lest <code>this</code> change out from under us, we don't have classes(Yet), we have various work arounds for the quirky behavior when the <code>new</code> keyword is forgotten, private members are only available via closures. To a lot of us, FP feels more natural anyways.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat said, typed functional languages will, without a doubt, be the best place to code in the style presented by this book. JavaScript will be our means of learning a paradigm, where you apply it is up to you. Luckily, the interfaces are mathematical and, as such, ubiquitous. You'll find yourself at home with swiftz, scalaz, haskell, purescript, and other mathematically inclined environments.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRead online at <a href=\"https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/\">Gitbook</a></p>\r\n","id":151884,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3078/?feed=opds","author":"drboolean","isOwn":false},{"category":["Copyright","Essays","Literary Collections","Literary Collections / Essays","Nonfiction","Social aspects","Social aspects of Technology","Technology"],"updated":"2015-10-25T21:20:56","language":"en","title":"Content: Selected Essays on Technology, Creativity, Copyright and the Future of the Future","issued":"2008","summary":"<p>\r\n\tHailed by Bruce Sterling as “a political activist, gizmo freak, junk collector, programmer, entrepreneur, and all-around Renaissance geek,” the Internet’s favorite high-tech culture maven is celebrated with the first collection of his infamous articles, essays, and polemics.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIrreverently championing free speech and universal access to information—even if it’s just a free download of the newest Britney Spears MP3—he leads off with a mutinous talk given at Microsoft on digital rights management, insisting that they stop treating their customers as criminals.

Broaching practical elements alongside economic histories, open licensing, monographs and funder policies, this book is a must-read for both those new to ideas about open-access scholarly communications and those with an already keen interest in the latest developments for the humanities.\r\n<br /><br />Print available from <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316161012\">Cambridge University Press</a>","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781107097896","urn:ISBN:9781316161012","urn:ISBN:9781107484016"],"id":140771,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/62/71/627181e8ff8f267525e460dc372479cb.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2492/?feed=opds","author":"Martin Paul Eve","isOwn":false},{"category":["Cosmology","Dogs","Fiction","Science Fiction"],"updated":"2015-02-06T17:16:21","language":"en","title":"Invaders from the Infinite","issued":"1961-2014","summary":"Invaders from the Infinite is a science fiction novel by author John W. Campbell, Jr.. It was simultaneously published in 1961 by Gnome Press in an edition of 4,000 copies and by Fantasy Press in an edition of 100 copies. The book was originally intended to be published by Fantasy Press, but was handed over to Gnome Press when Fantasy Press folded. Lloyd Eshbach, of Fantasy Press, who was responsible for the printing of both editions, printed the extra copies for his longtime customers. The Fantasy Press edition was issued without a dust-jacket. Eshbach eventually did produce a jacket in 1990 at the urging of George Zebrowski. The novel is an expansion of stories that originally appeared in the magazine Amazing Stories Quarterly.<br /><br />\r\nE. F. Bleiler described the novel as &quot;the early John W. Campbell story par excellence: weak novelistic skills combined with very strong speculative, imaginative theoretical physics. While one may be bored with [the] interminable lectures and rendered drowsy by the repeated space battles, but one must also admire Campbell's ingenuity in creating novel artifacts&quot;.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe novel concerns a trio of heroes, Arcot, Morey and Wade, and their attempts to help a race of superdogs.\r\n<br /><br />Summary from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invaders_from_the_Infinite\">Wikipedia</a>.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781612101927","urn:ISBN:9781434401045","urn:ISBN:9781434400994","urn:ISBN:9781434638182","urn:ISBN:9781604596625","urn:ISBN:9781406841824","urn:ISBN:9781468197563","urn:ISBN:9781499358827","urn:ISBN:9780554277097"],"id":142307,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/50/44/5044b2124a1e3aaa60c0380740128e66.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2642/?feed=opds","author":"John Wood Campbell","isOwn":false},{"category":["Internet","Nonfiction","Politics and government"],"updated":"2015-02-25T13:11:13","language":"en","title":"Open Source Democracy - How online communication is changing offline politics","issued":"2003","summary":"The internet has become an integral part of our lives because it is interactive. That means people are senders of information, rather than simply passive receivers of ‘old’ media. Most importantly of all, we can talk to each other without gatekeepers or editors. This offers exciting possibilities for new social networks, which are enabled – but not determined – by digital technology.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn the software industry, the open source movement emphasises collective cooperation over private ownership. This radical idea may provide the biggest challenge to the dominance of Microsoft. Open source enthusiasts have found a more efficient way of working by pooling their knowledge to encourage innovation.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAll this is happening at a time when participation in mainstream electoral politics is declining in many Western countries, including the US and Britain. Our democracies are increasingly resembling old media, with fewer real opportunities for interaction.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhat, asks Douglas Rushkoff in this original essay for Demos, would happen if the ‘source code’ of our democratic systems was opened up to the people they are meant to serve? ‘An open source model for participatory, bottom-up and emergent policy will force us to confront the issues of our time,’ he answers.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThat’s a profound thought at a time when governments are recognising the limits of centralised political institutions. The open source community recognises that solutions to problems emerge from the interaction and participation of lots of people, not by central planning.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nRushkoff challenges us all to participate in the redesign of political institutions in a way which enables new solutions to social problems to emerge as the result of millions interactions. In this way, online communication may indeed be able to change offline politics.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781841801131"],"id":143176,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/48/5c/485cc99890842d4acd1ba8402f257c37.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2677/?feed=opds","author":"Douglas Rushkoff","isOwn":false},{"category":["Computer network protocols","Digital communications","Internet","Nonfiction"],"updated":"2015-03-19T10:54:48","language":"en","title":"http2 explained","issued":"2014","summary":"This document describes http2 at a technical and protocol level.

As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes.<br /><br />\r\nThis book's goal is to change that. In it, the authors of twenty-five open source applications explain how their software is structured, and why. What are each program's major components? How do they interact?

In answering these questions, the contributors to this book provide unique insights into how they think.<br /><br />\r\nIf you are a junior developer, and want to learn how your more experienced colleagues think, this book is the place to start.

Washington detailing his personal experiences in working to rise from the position of a slave child during the Civil War, to the difficulties and obstacles he overcame to get an education at the new Hampton University, to his work establishing vocational schools—most notably the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama—to help black people and other disadvantaged minorities learn useful, marketable skills and work to pull themselves, as a race, up by the bootstraps. He reflects on the generosity of both teachers and philanthropists who helped in educating blacks and native Americans. He describes his efforts to instill manners, breeding, health and a feeling of dignity to students. His educational philosophy stresses combining academic subjects with learning a trade (something which is reminiscent of the educational theories of John Ruskin). Washington explained that the integration of practical subjects is partly designed to reassure the white community as to the usefulness of educating black people.<br /><br />\r\nThis book was first released as a serialized work in 1900 through The Outlook, a Christian newspaper of New York. This work was serialized because this meant that during the writing process, Washington was able to hear critiques and requests from his audience and could more easily adapt his paper to his diverse audience.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781594629976","urn:ISBN:9780486287386","urn:ISBN:9780140390513","urn:ISBN:9780451527547","urn:ISBN:9780760752340","urn:ISBN:9780192835628","urn:ISBN:9780199552399","urn:ISBN:9780393967258","urn:ISBN:9781602068018"],"id":66561,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/1a/79/1a79feced753622815414c58db92997e.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10722/?feed=opds","author":"Booker T.

Each story in &quot;The Dubliners&quot; is a gem, presenting a direct (though sometimes searing) view of Dublin in the early twentieth century. This classic collection of James Joyce short stories, which set the standard for the genre, is filled with characters who come to terrible revelations (or &quot;epiphanies&quot;) about how their lives had been scarred by the provincialism of Dublin, the divisiveness of its politics, and the oppression of religion. In essence the stories in &quot;The Dubliners&quot; are Joyce's portraits of the people of Dublin and the city itself, most of these stories are character sketches, mostly following a few people around as they go about their lives. The stories range from the psychologially simple (&quot;Counterparts&quot; and &quot;A Little Cloud&quot;) to the extraordinarily complex (&quot;A Painful Case&quot; and &quot;The Dead&quot;). The pinnacle of the collection, &quot;The Dead&quot; encompasses everything: politics, religion, art, journalism, history, love, and the inevitability of death. &quot;The Dead&quot; starts off mundanely enough, but if the last few pages don't send chills down your spine, then you must be dead. After that gem, everything else is just icing on the cake. While the ending of &quot;The Dead&quot; has been interpreted in hundreds of ways, there is no denying that as Joyce &quot;pulls back the camera&quot; from the Conroy's hotel room to the universe above the writing swells to its most beautiful. By itself, &quot;The Dead&quot; is a masterpiece which resonates long after you've read it. &quot;The Dubliners&quot; is Joyce's most accessible work, readable and enjoyable without losing any of its deeper nuances.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780486268705","urn:ISBN:9781580491655","urn:ISBN:9780141182452","urn:ISBN:9780192839992","urn:ISBN:9780140042221","urn:ISBN:9780140622171","urn:ISBN:9781853260483","urn:ISBN:9780140186475","urn:ISBN:9780553213805"],"id":5650,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=i1nhpOzk1-oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4840/?feed=opds","author":"James Joyce","isOwn":false},{"category":["Intellectual property","Law","Nonfiction","OverDrive","Public domain (Copyright law)"],"updated":"2013-10-23T06:10:37","language":"en","title":"The public domain","issued":"2008-2013","summary":"In this enlightening book James Boyle describes what he calls the range wars of the information age--today's heated battles over intellectual property. Boyle argues that just as every informed citizen needs to know at least something about the environment or civil rights, every citizen should also understand intellectual property law. Why? Because intellectual property rights mark out the ground rules of the information society, and today's policies are unbalanced, unsupported by evidence, and often detrimental to cultural access, free speech, digital creativity, and scientific innovation. Boyle identifies as a major problem the widespread failure to understand the importance of the public domain--the realm of material that everyone is free to use and share without permission or fee. The public domain is as vital to innovation and culture as the realm of material protected by intellectual property rights, he asserts, and he calls for a movement akin to the environmental movement to preserve it. With a clear analysis of issues ranging from Jefferson's philosophy of innovation to musical sampling, synthetic biology and Internet file sharing, this timely book brings a positive new perspective to important cultural and legal debates. If we continue to enclose the &quot;commons of the mind,&quot; Boyle argues, we will all be the poorer.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780300137408","urn:ISBN:9780300158342","urn:ISBN:9780300150698","urn:ISBN:9781616100773","urn:ISBN:9783849513375"],"id":8693,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=Imn6yQjcfZIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/995/?feed=opds","author":"James Boyle","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","Fiction / Science Fiction","Magic","Science Fiction","Wizards"],"updated":"2014-02-11T09:34:44","language":"en","title":"Spell of Catastrophe","issued":"1989-2015","summary":"<p>\r\n\tWelcome to the Dance of Gods!

G. Wells. It describes the experiences of an unnamed narrator who travels through the suburbs of London as England is invaded by Martians. It is one of the earliest stories that details a conflict between mankind and an alien race.The War of the Worlds is split into two parts, Book one: The Coming of the Martians, and Book two: The Earth under the Martians. The novel is narrated by a writer of philosophical articles who throughout the narrative struggles to reunite with his wife, while witnessing the Martians rampaging through the southern English counties. Part one also features the tale of his brother, who accompanies two women to the coast in the hope of escaping England as it is invaded.The plot has been related to invasion literature of the time. The novel has been variously interpreted as a commentary on evolutionary theory, British imperialism, and generally Victorian fears and prejudices. At the time of publication it was classified as a scientific romance, like his earlier novel The Time Machine. Since then, it has influenced much literature and other media, spawning half a dozen feature films, radio dramas, various comic book adaptations, a television series, and sequels or parallel stories by other authors. It also influenced the real-life work of scientists, notably the rocket scientist Robert H. Goddard.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780375759239","urn:ISBN:9780812505153","urn:ISBN:9781936594054","urn:ISBN:9780451522764","urn:ISBN:9781593080853","urn:ISBN:9780486295060","urn:ISBN:9780553213386","urn:ISBN:9781403717160","urn:ISBN:9781453603802"],"id":62523,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=35M6PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4753/?feed=opds","author":"Herbert George Wells","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","Popular music","Protected DAISY","Science Fiction"],"updated":"2014-04-09T10:37:30","language":"en","title":"Buddy Holly Is Alive and Well on Ganymede","issued":"1991-1994","summary":"When televisions worldwide begin broadcasting a nonstop, noninterruptible live performance by Buddy Holly purporting to originate somewhere in the vicinity of Jupiter, Oliver Vale--the apparent object of the broadcasts--finds himself drafted for a mission so secret that even he is not sure of its purpose.

A computer supported only a small number of languages, the user configured his region to support languages of close countries. Memories and disks were expensive, all applications were written to use byte strings using 8 bits encodings: one byte per character was a good compromise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today with the Internet and the globalization, we all read and exchange documents from everywhere around the world (even if we don’t understand everything). The problem is that documents rarely indicate their language (encoding), and displaying a document with the wrong encoding leads to a well known problem: mojibake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to get, or worse, guess the encoding of a document. Except for encodings of the UTF family (coming from the Unicode standard), there is no reliable algorithm for that. We have to rely on statistics to guess the most probable encoding, which is done by most Internet browsers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unicode support by operating systems, programming languages and libraries varies a lot. In general, the support is basic or non-existent. Each operating system manages Unicode differently. For example, Windows stores filenames as Unicode, whereas UNIX and BSD operating systems use bytes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixing documents stored as bytes is possible, even if they use different encodings, but leads to mojibake. Because libraries and programs do also ignore encode and decode warnings or errors, write a single character with a diacritic (any non-ASCII character) is sometimes enough to get an error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Full Unicode support is complex because the Unicode charset is bigger than any other charset. For example, ISO 8859-1 contains 256 code points including 191 characters, whereas Unicode version 6.0 contains 248,966 assigned code points. The Unicode standard is larger than just a charset: it explains also how to display characters (e.g. left- to-right for English and right-to-left for persian), how to normalize a character string (e.g. precomposed characters versus the decomposed form), etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book explains how to sympathize with Unicode, and how you should modify your program to avoid most, or all, issues related to encodings and Unicode.</p>\r\n","id":152553,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3143/?feed=opds","author":"Victor Stinner","isOwn":false},{"category":["Science Fiction"],"updated":"2016-02-06T23:15:24","language":"en","title":"Alien Minds","issued":"1955","summary":"<p>The ability to read minds isn't an unmixed blessing, so learns George Hanlon, Secret Operative of the Inter-Stellar Corps.

Scrooge is established within the first stave (chapter) as a greedy and stingy businessman who has no place in his life for kindness, compassion, charity, or benevolence. After being warned by Marley's ghost to change his ways, Scrooge is visited by three additional ghosts &quot;each in its turn&quot; who accompany him to various scenes with the hope of achieving his transformation.The first of the spirits, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to the scenes of his boyhood and youth which stir the old miser's gentle and tender side by reminding him of a time when he was more innocent. The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to several radically differing scenes (a joy-filled market of people buying the makings of Christmas dinner, the family feast of Scrooge's near-impoverished clerk Bob Cratchit, a miner's cottage, and a lighthouse among other sites) in order to evince from the miser a sense of responsibility for his fellow man. The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, harrows Scrooge with dire visions of the future if he does not learn and act upon what he has witnessed. Scrooge's own neglected and untended grave is revealed, prompting the miser to aver that he will change his ways in hopes of changing these &quot;shadows of what may be.&quot;In the fifth and final stave, Scrooge awakens Christmas morning with joy and love in his heart, then spends the day with his nephew's family after anonymously sending a prize turkey to the Crachit home for Christmas dinner. Scrooge has become a different man overnight, and now treats his fellow men with kindness, generosity, and compassion, gaining a reputation as a man who embodies the spirit of Christmas. The story closes with the narrator confirming the validity, completeness, and permanence of Scrooge's transformation.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780804900263","urn:ISBN:9781561797462","urn:ISBN:9781580495790","urn:ISBN:9780486268651","urn:ISBN:9780763631208","urn:ISBN:9780553212440","urn:ISBN:9781440423918","urn:ISBN:9780893753566","urn:ISBN:9780439101332"],"id":13950,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=GL3qQwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4582/?feed=opds","author":"Charles Dickens","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Classic Literature","Didactic fiction","Domestic fiction","England -- Fiction","England -- Social life and customs -- 19th century -- Fiction","English language","Fiction","Gentry","Gentry -- England -- Fiction","GITenberg","Historical fiction","Humorous stories","In library","Inheritance and succession","Inheritance and succession -- Fiction","Literature","Love stories","Mate selection","Mate selection -- Fiction","OverDrive","PR","Protected DAISY","Readers","Regency fiction","Romance","Sisters","Sisters -- Fiction","Social classes","Social classes -- Fiction","Social life and customs","Text-books for foreigners","Young women","Young women -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-07-27T14:34:28","language":"en","title":"Sense and Sensibility","issued":"1931-2012","summary":"A tale of two sistersTwo sisters of opposing temperaments are brought to a closer understanding by their mutual disappointments—and true love finally triumphs when sense gives way to sensibility and sensibility to sense.

Permanently challenging, it has found new applications and new refutations in every generation. Hobbes argues that human beings are first and foremost concerned with their own individual desires and fears. He shows that a conflict of each against every man can only be avoided by the adoption of a compact to enforce peace. The compact involves giving up some of our natural freedom to a sovereign power which will enforce the laws of peace on all citizens. Hobbes also analyses the subversive forces - religion, ambition, private conscience - that threaten to destroy the body politic, Leviathan itself, and return us to the state of war. This new edition reproduces the first printed text, retaining the original punctuation but modernizing the spelling, and incorporating the corrections found in the best copies. It offers exceptionally thorough and useful annotation, and introduction that guides the reader through the complexities of Hobbes's arguments, and a substantial index.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780192834980","urn:ISBN:9780140431957","urn:ISBN:9780872201774","urn:ISBN:9780521567978","urn:ISBN:9780684842950","urn:ISBN:9780199537280","urn:ISBN:9781843710264","urn:ISBN:9780140400021","urn:ISBN:9780020655206"],"id":66667,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=DhlOzCmNYj8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4513/?feed=opds","author":"Thomas Hobbes","isOwn":false},{"category":["Nonfiction","Software"],"updated":"2014-01-30T10:18:49","language":"en","title":"Introduction to Programming Using Java","issued":"2009-2011","summary":"Introduction to Programming Using JAVA. 700 pages.

Users, aided by improvements in computer and communications technology, increasingly can develop their own new products and services. These innovating users - both individuals and firms - often freely share their innovations with others, creating user-innovation communities and a rich intellectual commons. In Democratizing Innovation Eric von Hippel looks closely at this emerging user-centered innovation system, which is affecting both information products and physical products. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nDrawing on work done with several coauthors, von Hippel explores why and when users find it profitable to develop new products and services for themselves, and why it often pays users to reveal their innovations freely for the use of all. Drawing on work with Nikolaus Franke, Pam Morrison and others, he documents that product and service development is concentrated among lead user firms and individuals. Lead users that are ahead on marketplace trends do not replicate manufacturer development efforts. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nInstead, they develop products that are not yet available. Later manufacturers find many of these user-developed products to be the basis for commercial products. Drawing upon work with Dietmar Harhoff, Joachim Henkel and others, von Hippel reports that user innovation has a positive impact on social welfare, and propose that government policies, including R&amp;D subsidies and tax credits, should be realigned to eliminate biases against it. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nAvailable in print via <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/democratizing-innovation\">MIT Press</a>","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780262002745","urn:ISBN:9780262720472","urn:ISBN:9780262220743"],"id":142278,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=BvCvxqxYAuAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2639/?feed=opds","author":"Eric von Hippel","isOwn":false},{"category":["Biography","History"],"updated":"2015-02-11T19:03:36","language":"en","title":"Voices from the Past","issued":"2007","summary":"Voices from the Past consists of five finely crafted, lyrical novels that portray the inner lives of five extraordinary people: Sappho’s Journal (which includes a preface by Sappho scholar and translator Willis Barnstone), Christ’s Journal, Leonardo da Vinci’s Journal, Shakespeare’s Journal, and Lincoln’s Journal.

Today's increasingly fast pace of software development--as programmers make small changes to software one day only to undo them the next--has only heightened the problem; consecutive work on code or single-programmer software is a rare sight these days. Without careful attention to version control, concurrent and collaborative work can create more headaches than it solves. This is where Subversion comes into play. \r\n<br /><br />Written by members of the Subversion open source development team, &quot;Version Control with Subversion&quot; introduces the powerful new versioning tool designed to be the successor to the Concurrent Version System or CVS. CVS users will find the &quot;look and feel&quot; Subversion comfortably familiar, but under the surface it's far more flexible, robust, and usable, and more importantly, it improves on CVS's more notable flaws. The book begins with a general introduction to Subversion, the basic concepts behind version control, and a guided tour of Subversion's capabilities and structure. With thorough attention to detail, the authors cover every aspect of installing and configuring Subversion for managing a programming project, documentation, or any other team-based endeavor. Later chapters cover the more complex topics of branching, repository administration, and other advanced features such as properties, externals, and access control. The book ends with reference material and appendices covering a number of useful topics such as a Subversion complete reference and troubleshooting guide. &quot;Version Control with Subversion&quot; aims to be useful to readers of widelydifferent backgrounds, from those with no previous experience in version control to experienced sysadmins. If you've never used version control, you'll find everything you need to get started in this book. And if you're a seasoned CVS pro, this book will help you make a painless leap into Subversion.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLinks to print and source (and subversion repository!) available at <a href=\"http://svnbook.red-bean.com/\">Red Bean Software</a>.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780596004484","urn:ISBN:9780596510336"],"id":85,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/38/9c/389caa82e5da552e2689d1f5ce0000d9.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2882/?feed=opds","author":"Ben Collins-Sussman","isOwn":false},{"category":["Ebooks","Internet","Nonfiction","Open access publishing"],"updated":"2015-10-06T00:15:42","language":"en","title":"An Open Web: The Web is Closed.

He is currently being held at Adra Prison in Damascus by the Syrian government.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nSince his arrest, Bassel’s valuable volunteer work, both in Syria and around the world, has been stopped. His absence has been painful for the communities that depend on him.

As a professor of philosophy during the early days of the internet, he realized its power and potential as a medium for scholarship. As he writes now, “it was like an asteroid crash, fundamentally changing the environment, challenging dinosaurs to adapt, and challenging all of us to figure out whether we were dinosaurs.” When Suber began putting his writings and course materials online for anyone to use for any purpose, he soon experienced the benefits of that wider exposure. In 2001, he started a newsletter—the Free Online Scholarship Newsletter, which later became the SPARC Open Access Newsletter—in which he explored the implications of open access for research and scholarship. This book offers a selection of some of Suber’s most significant and influential writings on open access from 2002 to 2010.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn these texts, Suber makes the case for open access to research; answers common questions, objections, and misunderstandings; analyzes policy issues; and documents the growth and evolution of open access during its most critical early decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Print editions available from <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/knowledge-unbound\">MIT Press</a>.</p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780262029902","urn:ISBN:9780262528498"],"id":157745,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=js3RCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3579/?feed=opds","author":"Peter Suber","isOwn":false},{"category":["Computers","Computers / Operating Systems","Computers / Operating Systems / Linux","Linux","Operating systems (Computers)"],"updated":"2016-04-15T16:34:31","language":"en","title":"Linux Inside","issued":"2016","summary":"<p>A book-in-progress about the linux kernel and its insides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The goal is simple</strong> - to share my modest knowledge about the insides of the linux kernel and help people who are interested in linux kernel insides, and other low-level subject matter. - @0xAX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read online at <a href=\"https://www.gitbook.com/book/0xax/linux-insides/details\">Gitbooks</a>.</p>\r\n","id":158235,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/c0/a8/c0a89fa2893f9c5fd73aa68f9ec18611.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3630/?feed=opds","author":"OxAX","isOwn":false},{"category":["Job hunting","Self-help","Self-help / Motivational & Inspirational","Unemployment"],"updated":"2016-04-19T10:34:05","language":"en","title":"Advice for Young, Unemployed Workers","issued":"2013","summary":"<p>We are now nearing a decade of very choppy hiring markets for young workers.

Its originality shocked contemporary readers on its publication in 1916 who found its treating of the minutiae of daily life as indecorous, and its central character unappealing. Was it art or was it filth? The novel charts the intellectual, moral, and sexual development of Stephen Dedalus, from his childhood listening to his father's stories through his schooldays and adolescence to the brink of adulthood and independence, and his awakening as an artist. Growing up in a Catholic family in Dublin in the final years of the nineteenth century, Stephen's consciousness is forged by Irish history and politics, by Catholicism and culture, language and art. Stephen's story mirrors that of Joyce himself, and the novel is both startlingly realistic and brilliantly crafted, not to mention that it is one of the founding texts of Modernism and the precursor of the acclaimed Ulysses. For this edition Jeri Johnson, an eminent Joyce scholar, has written an introduction and notes which together provide a comprehensive and illuminating appreciation of Joyce's artistry.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780192839985","urn:ISBN:9780142437346","urn:ISBN:9780140042214","urn:ISBN:9780451530158","urn:ISBN:9780486280509","urn:ISBN:9780140186833","urn:ISBN:9781853260063","urn:ISBN:9780451525444","urn:ISBN:9780140622300"],"id":66714,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=RbGAVT0JF_kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4663/?feed=opds","author":"James Joyce","isOwn":false},{"category":["Nonfiction"],"updated":"2014-11-20T14:36:10","language":"en","title":"A Radically Modern Approach to Introductory Physics, Volume I","issued":"2009-2012","summary":"This nontraditional text arose from the conviction that science and engineering students would benefit from an introductory course which covers all of physics from a modern point of view.

This is Volume 1, which covers:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Waves, including geometrical optics</li>\r\n<li>Theory of relativity</li>\r\n<li>Relativistic matter waves and quantum mechanics</li>\r\n<li>Classical mechanics as the geometric optics limit of quantum mechanics</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe result is a conceptually challenging but mathematically simple text which can be covered in two semesters or three quarters without omitting any content.

The two separate portions, <a href=\"https://unglue.it/work/117972/\">The Land of the Infidel</a> and The Holy War are a continuous tale.<br /><br />\r\nBasically ignored during its publication - and subsequently out of print, although still enjoying strong reviews and a cult following by those who have read it - the novel is the portrayal of an English-born man named David, who is captured as a very young child and sold into slavery to Baibars, a Mamluk officer. He becomes a devout believer in Islam and takes the Arabic form of his name and the surname of a convert, Daoud ibn Abdullah. He develops into a gifted warrior and assassin. He is sent to the Papal Court in Orvieto in the 13th century as a spy, in order to foil an alliance between the Christian West and the Mongolian descendants of Genghis Khan to exterminate the Muslim faith and capture the Holy Land.\r\nDaoud was also trained by the Hashishyya, a heretical Islamic order. One of the many spellings of their name, Hashshashin, is where we derive the modern word &quot;assassin&quot;. Shea spends considerable time discussing their techniques and philosophy, and it is a major theme of the book.<br /><br />\r\nMany of the characters in the novel, such as Thomas Aquinas, Baibars, King Manfred of Sicily, Louis IX, and Charles of Anjou are historical figures, woven into the fictional canvas Shea invented. Some historians believe that an alliance was attempted by the Papal Court (with Louis IX's backing) with the Mongols against the Muslim world, which ultimately failed. Shea has created a fictional scenario to explain this failure, and his firmly historical figures (such as Aquinas) are set side-by-side with wholly fictional characters and semi-legendary figures such as the Italian poet Sordello, who appears in Dante's Purgatorio and with whom Shea has also taken considerable poetic license.<br /><br />\r\nOther major fictional characters include Sophia, a Byzantine woman who is a member of Manfred's court (and Manfred's former concubine) who accompanies Daoud on his mission, and Simon de Gobingnon, a French knight assigned to protect the Mongol ambassadors. He is Daoud's chief nemesis and the son of the major characters in Shea's All Things Are Lights. While Daoud is unquestionably the hero of the novel, those who have read All Things Are Lights and are familiar with Simon's background will find themselves often sympathizing with the young Simon's attempts to live up to his birthright.<br /><br />\r\nOstensibly an adventure tale, the novel is also a thinly veiled look into secret societies such as the Hashishin and the Templar Knights. These are subjects which Shea has tackled in many books, most famously his Illuminatus! Trilogy, co-written with Robert Anton Wilson. While many of Shea's books after Illuminatus!, such as Shike and All Things Are Lights, deal with the secret societies he clearly had interest in, few of his other books interweave his scholarly investigations of these societies into as compelling a story.<br /><br />Description from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saracen\">Wikipedia</a>.

The ancient, nomadic way of life is coming to an end; the agricultural revolution has begun. When the farmers of Burh attack the sleeping nomad tribe, Tagart is the only survivor. Twenty-five and heir to the chief, his sole inheritance now is his tribal honour – and it demands revenge. His ally is the forest itself: that, and his own ingenuity, courage and hunting skill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the men of Burh, settlers from continental Europe, fall upon the sleeping nomad tribe in the depths of the forest amid the Downs of southern England, Tagart is the only survivor, escaping by sheer chance after his wife and young son have been massacred. Twenty-five and heir to the chiefdom of the roving hunters, he sees his only inheritance now to be an overwhelming urge for merciless revenge - of his family, his tribe and indeed of a way of life which in the England of 5,000 years ago is steadily being eroded by these tillers of the soil.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTagart’s first objective for his single-handed work of retribution is the fortified village of Burh (in what is now known as the Cuckmere Valley), and the means he uses are more subtle and deadly than any traditional form of attack.

The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will to Truth not laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is already a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away? That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves? WHO is it really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really is this &quot;Will to Truth&quot; in us? In fact we made a long halt at the question as to the origin of this Will - until at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired aboutthe VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth presented itself before us - or was it we who presented ourselves before the problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which the Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140449235","urn:ISBN:9780679724650","urn:ISBN:9780140445138","urn:ISBN:9781420922509","urn:ISBN:9780486298689","urn:ISBN:9781936594078","urn:ISBN:9780192832634","urn:ISBN:9780521779135","urn:ISBN:9780199537075"],"id":2320,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=buiQ96RU4VIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16202/?feed=opds","author":"Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","B","GITenberg","In library","Introductions","Knowledge, Theory of","Literature","Metaphysics","Métaphysique","Nonfiction","OverDrive","Philosophie","Philosophy","Philosophy -- Introductions","Protected DAISY","Theory of Knowledge"],"updated":"2016-11-14T14:32:41","language":"en","title":"The problems of philosophy","issued":"1912-2011","summary":"The Problems of Philosophy (1912) is one of Bertrand Russell's attempts to create a brief and accessible guide to the problems of philosophy. Focusing on problems he believes will provoke positive and constructive discussion, Russell concentrates on knowledge rather than metaphysics. If it is uncertain that external objects exist, how can we then have knowledge of them but by probability. There is no reason to doubt the existence of external objects simply because of sense data. Russell guides the reader through his famous 1910 distinction between &quot;knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description&quot; and introduces important theories of Plato, Aristotle, Ren Descartes, David Hume, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel and others to lay the foundation for philosophical inquiry by general readers and scholars alike. &quot;In the following pages I have confined myself in the main to those problems of philosophy in regard to which I thought it possible to say something positive and constructive, since merely negative criticism seemed out of place. For this reason, theory of knowledge occupies a larger space than metaphysics in the present volume, and some topics much discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all.&quot; Bertrand Russell, Preface of The Problems of Philosophy","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780195002126","urn:ISBN:9780195115529","urn:ISBN:9780198880189","urn:ISBN:9780192854230","urn:ISBN:9781421903675","urn:ISBN:9781605978994","urn:ISBN:9780760756041","urn:ISBN:9780486406749","urn:ISBN:9781434638427"],"id":66906,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=3GRwpwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/22377/?feed=opds","author":"Bertrand Russell","isOwn":false},{"category":["Nonfiction"],"updated":"2014-08-07T16:25:42","language":"en","title":"The Psychology of Emotions, Feelings and Thoughts","issued":"2008","summary":"This book is online for free at <a href=\"http://cnx.org/content/m14310/latest/?collection=col10447/latest&quot;\">CNX.ORG</a> - This book makes the statement that thought, action and feeling can occur in any order, it also puts forth the idea that life is divided into three groups, emotion, thinking, and feeling. These three groups make humans feel in certain ways, thinking, physical stimulus, and emotion all contribute to feeling. But what is the difference between a thought, an emotion, and a feeling? Is there an overlap between the three? Probably, since any emotion can be broken down into the sensations and real events that caused it, and these events all lead to emotions, feelings and thoughts. So emotions, feelings and thoughts all might have the same source, they are just expressed differently in the mind. Where do your emotions, feelings and thoughts rate on a scale of clarity?

First, JavaScript Allongé gives you the tools to deal with JavaScript bugs, hitches, edge cases, and other potential pitfalls.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere are plenty of good directions for how to write JavaScript programs. If you follow them without alteration or deviation, you will be satisfied. Unfortunately, software is a complex thing, full of interactions and side-effects. Two perfectly reasonable pieces of advice when taken separately may conflict with each other when taken together. An approach may seem sound at the outset of a project, but need to be revised when new requirements are discovered.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhen you “leave the path” of the directions, you discover their limitations. In order to solve the problems that occur at the edges, in order to adapt and deal with changes, in order to refactor and rewrite as needed, you need to understand the underlying principles of the JavaScript programming language in detail.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nYou need to understand why the directions work so that you can understand how to modify them to work properly at or beyond their original limitations. That’s where JavaScript Allongé comes in.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nJavaScript Allongé is a book about programming with functions, because JavaScript is a programming language built on flexible and powerful functions. JavaScript Allongé begins at the beginning, with values and expressions, and builds from there to discuss types, identity, functions, closures, scopes, and many more subjects up to working with classes and instances. In each case, JavaScript Allongé takes care to explain exactly how things work so that when you encounter a problem, you’ll know exactly what is happening and how to fix it.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSecond, JavaScript Allongé provides recipes for using functions to write software that is simpler, cleaner, and less complicated than alternative approaches that are object-centric or code-centric. JavaScript idioms like function combinators and decorators leverage JavaScript’s power to make code easier to read, modify, debug and refactor, thus avoiding problems before they happen.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nJavaScript Allongé teaches you how to handle complex code, and it also teaches you how to simplify code without dumbing it down. As a result, JavaScript Allongé is a rich read releasing many of JavaScript’s subtleties, much like the Café Allongé beloved by coffee enthusiasts everywhere.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe author's books are online <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/u/raganwald\">at Leanpub</a>.","id":145237,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=DaUMAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2819/?feed=opds","author":"Reginald Braithwaite","isOwn":false},{"category":["Baking","Chemistry","Nutrition","Organic Chemistry","Science","Textbooks"],"updated":"2015-06-17T13:39:29","language":"en","title":"From Vitamins to Baked Goods: Real Applications of Organic Chemistry","issued":"2012","summary":"This stand-alone textbook module intends to provide some motivation for studying organic chemistry.

The two separate portions, The Land of the Infidel and <a href=\"https://unglue.it/work/146074/\">The Holy War</a> are a continuous tale.<br /><br />\r\nBasically ignored during its publication - and subsequently out of print, although still enjoying strong reviews and a cult following by those who have read it - the novel is the portrayal of an English-born man named David, who is captured as a very young child and sold into slavery to Baibars, a Mamluk officer. He becomes a devout believer in Islam and takes the Arabic form of his name and the surname of a convert, Daoud ibn Abdullah. He develops into a gifted warrior and assassin. He is sent to the Papal Court in Orvieto in the 13th century as a spy, in order to foil an alliance between the Christian West and the Mongolian descendants of Genghis Khan to exterminate the Muslim faith and capture the Holy Land.\r\nDaoud was also trained by the Hashishyya, a heretical Islamic order. One of the many spellings of their name, Hashshashin, is where we derive the modern word &quot;assassin&quot;. Shea spends considerable time discussing their techniques and philosophy, and it is a major theme of the book.<br /><br />\r\nMany of the characters in the novel, such as Thomas Aquinas, Baibars, King Manfred of Sicily, Louis IX, and Charles of Anjou are historical figures, woven into the fictional canvas Shea invented. Some historians believe that an alliance was attempted by the Papal Court (with Louis IX's backing) with the Mongols against the Muslim world, which ultimately failed. Shea has created a fictional scenario to explain this failure, and his firmly historical figures (such as Aquinas) are set side-by-side with wholly fictional characters and semi-legendary figures such as the Italian poet Sordello, who appears in Dante's Purgatorio and with whom Shea has also taken considerable poetic license.<br /><br />\r\nOther major fictional characters include Sophia, a Byzantine woman who is a member of Manfred's court (and Manfred's former concubine) who accompanies Daoud on his mission, and Simon de Gobingnon, a French knight assigned to protect the Mongol ambassadors. He is Daoud's chief nemesis and the son of the major characters in Shea's All Things Are Lights. While Daoud is unquestionably the hero of the novel, those who have read All Things Are Lights and are familiar with Simon's background will find themselves often sympathizing with the young Simon's attempts to live up to his birthright.<br /><br />\r\nOstensibly an adventure tale, the novel is also a thinly veiled look into secret societies such as the Hashishin and the Templar Knights. These are subjects which Shea has tackled in many books, most famously his Illuminatus! Trilogy, co-written with Robert Anton Wilson. While many of Shea's books after Illuminatus!, such as Shike and All Things Are Lights, deal with the secret societies he clearly had interest in, few of his other books interweave his scholarly investigations of these societies into as compelling a story.<br /><br />Description from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saracen\">Wikipedia</a>.

It was her first and only published novel: she died the following year, at age 30. The decision to publish came after the success of her sister Charlotte's novel, Jane Eyre. After Emily's death, Charlotte edited the manuscript of Wuthering Heights, and arranged for the edited version to be published as a posthumous second edition in 1850.<br /><br />\r\nWuthering Heights is the name of the farmhouse on the North York Moors where the story unfolds. The book's core theme is the destructive effect that jealousy and vengefulness have, both on the jealous or vengeful individuals and on their communities.<br /><br />\r\nAlthough Wuthering Heights is now widely regarded as a classic of English literature, it received mixed reviews when first published, and was considered controversial because its depiction of mental and physical cruelty was unusually stark, and it challenged strict Victorian ideals of the day, including religious hypocrisy, morality, social classes and gender inequality. The English poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti referred to it as &quot;A fiend of a book – an incredible monster ... The action is laid in hell, – only it seems places and people have English names there.&quot;","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780393978896","urn:ISBN:9780393957600","urn:ISBN:9780393094008","urn:ISBN:9780393997729","urn:ISBN:9780393042306","urn:ISBN:9783193229588","urn:ISBN:9780717286836","urn:ISBN:9789174581416","urn:ISBN:9788711225509"],"id":65218,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=bt6CZwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4540/?feed=opds","author":"Emily Brontë","isOwn":false},{"category":["Children's literature, English","Christmas","Christmas stories","Fiction"],"updated":"2014-12-24T11:46:50","language":"en","title":"'Twas the Night Before Christmas","issued":"1848-2012","summary":"There are over 300 print editions of this Christmas classic in our database.

What is revisionism? It is the retelling of history from a point of view that differs from the mainstream, which always treats the victor (the state) as glorious and the conquered (individual liberty) as deserving of its fate.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nObviously the libertarian telling of American history is going to be different. The state and its creations are not the heroes. The producers of capital, the average people, the voluntary society: these are the forces that make up civilization.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere is a massive literature of revisionist American history. It is so vast, in fact, that people whose field is economics, law, or philosophy can feel intimidated by it all, especially since this material is not taught in class. Must we accept the idea that the architects of the Constitution loved liberty, that Lincoln was a liberator, that the United States had to crush Spain in the late 19th century, that World War I was unavoidable, that the U.S. was always the good guy in the Cold War?\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNo, not at all, say the revisionists. They tell a version of events that turns every convention on its head. But there is yet another problem here: most of the major revisionist historians are writing from the point of view of the political left, and their interpretation is skewed by that bias. What Riggenbach does is offer a thoroughgoing critique of leftwing revisionism in favor of a distinctly libertarian form of revisionism.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis book is a roundup of the major figures and the most important books; it is also a clear-headed assessment of all the major controversies. What you get from this one book is what would otherwise take a student months or years of searching in the library to locate and learn. There has never been anything like it.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nHe covers the work of Kenneth Roberts, John Dos Passos, Gore Vidal, Harry Elmer Barnes, James J. Martin, Charles A. Beard, William Appleman Williams, Murray Rothbard, Thomas Woods, among many others. He weighs on the great issues of whether the Old Right was really part of the &quot;right&quot; and how the definitions of these terms change. He defends Thomas Woods against his critics among the mainstream while arguing that Woods is not a conservative at all but rather an old-style liberal.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis book is written in an engaging style, with the goal of sharing as much knowledge of this literature with the reader as is possible. In this way, this book opens up whole worlds you never knew existed.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThere is no longer any reason to feel lost in the thicket of interpretation and reinterpretation. Like Virgil in the Inferno, Riggenbach is your guide.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781610163040"],"id":137397,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=HFEHf7J33moC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1290/?feed=opds","author":"Riggenbach, Jeff","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","Science Fiction"],"publishers":[{"publisher":"1889 Labs Limited"}],"updated":"2014-09-05T10:41:47","language":"en","title":"Dustrunners:Typhoon","issued":"2011","summary":"Kani isn't Tundra.

The story describes major technological developments and pivotal legal struggles, as well as fascinating profiles of hacker Richard Stallman, copyright scholar Lawrence Lessig, and other colorful figures.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nA milestone in reporting on the Internet by one of our leading media critics, Viral Spiral is for anyone seeking to take the full measure of the new digital era.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBuy a hard copy at <a href=\"http://thenewpress.com/books/viral-spiral\">The New Press</a>","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781595583963","urn:ISBN:9781595584588"],"id":143004,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=9WT5PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2664/?feed=opds","author":"David Bollier","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","Science Fiction"],"updated":"2015-03-06T12:29:06","language":"en","title":"Fearful Symmetry -  A Terran Empire Novel","issued":"1992","summary":"For the first time in his century-long career, Fleet-Captain Arjen of Clan D'gameh disapproved of a mission he had been given.

A dragon made of star stuff, so alien that only a human expedition to observe and perhaps capture it, could truly understand it. It’s a perilous journey into the future, however, for SS Cygni is 245 light-years from Earth, and even though only two years subjective time will pass on board the Karamojo, the crew will return to an Earth where five hundred years have passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Captain Lena Fang doesn’t care–she has made her life on her ship, where her best friend is the ship’s AI. Samuel Fisher, the contract exobiologist, doesn’t care, either. He is making the voyage of a lifetime and in the small world of the Karamojo he will have to live with the consequences of his obsessive quest for knowledge. The rest of the small crew–Axel Henderson, the biosystems engineer; Sylvia Devereaux, the beautiful physical sciences expert; and Phil Stearn, the ship’s jack-of-all-trades–have their own reasons for saying good-bye to everyone they have ever known. As the Biolathe AI said, uncertain five hundred-year round trips don’t attract the most stable personalities, but somehow they’ll have to learn to get along with each other if they’re to catch their dragon and come home again. For at the end of the journey is the star dragon–a creature of fire with a nuclear furnace for a heart. The crew of the Karamojo–human and AI alike–will risk everything to capture it, and it will take all their technology, all their skill and more courage than they knew they had, to come home alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Print editions and more books by Mike Brotherton ar availabel via the <a href=\"http://www.mikebrotherton.com/fiction/\">author's web site.</a></p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9789635231478","urn:ISBN:9780765346773","urn:ISBN:9780765307583"],"id":159821,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3869/?feed=opds","author":"Mike Brotherton","isOwn":false},{"category":["Business & Economics","Business & Economics / Economic History","Economics","Markets"],"updated":"2016-05-24T22:21:45","language":"en","title":"I, Pencil","issued":"2009","summary":"<p>“Eloquent.

As Mr Hyde's crimes gain the attention of the police, the manhunt is on; but every lead on Hyde consistently leads back to Jekyll instead. When the darker truth of Hyde's identity becomes clear to all, that the monstrous predator of London's industrial-fog enshrouded streets is none other than Jekyll himself, transformed by a tincture of his own making, he sets forth to destroy himself and bring down Hyde with him. Allegedly written within a single week under the influence of cocaine, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is one of Scottish prose-poet Robert Louis Stevenson's most famous and influential works. It has been remade and adapted into numerous other mediums, including film, television, stage performance, and graphic novel; endlessly quoted in a host of derivative works, speeches, and religious sermons; it even served as the foundation of Freudian psychology and the inspiration for Freud's allegorical tale, The Beast Within. It is widely considered to be the quintessential tale on the duality of the individual, and the danger of suppressing humanity's baser instincts for the outward appearance of morality.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780486266886","urn:ISBN:9780894714917","urn:ISBN:9780553212778","urn:ISBN:9780451523938","urn:ISBN:9781936594641","urn:ISBN:9781580495776","urn:ISBN:9781936041138","urn:ISBN:9781456364519","urn:ISBN:9781403709790"],"id":62524,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=HJXvFWO5FLcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4795/?feed=opds","author":"Robert Louis Stevenson","isOwn":false},{"category":["Children's literature, English","Detective and mystery stories","England -- Fiction","English Authors","Fiction","Fiction / Mystery & Detective","Fiction / Mystery & Detective / Traditional British","GITenberg","Holmes, Sherlock (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","PR","Private investigators -- England -- Fiction","Sherlock Holmes (Fictitious character)"],"updated":"2016-08-05T23:20:01","language":"en","title":"A Study in Scarlet","issued":"1887-2015","summary":"<p><em><strong>A Study in Scarlet</strong></em> is an 1887 detective novel by British author Arthur Conan Doyle.

The book's title derives from a speech given by Holmes, an amateur detective, to his friend and chronicler Watson on the nature of his work, in which he describes the story's murder investigation as his &quot;study in scarlet&quot;: &quot;There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.&quot; (A &quot;study&quot; is a preliminary drawing, sketch or painting done in preparation for a finished piece.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story, and its main characters, attracted little public interest when it first appeared.

Do social media affect the quality of teens’ lives? In this eye-opening book, youth culture and technology expert danah boyd uncovers some of the major myths regarding teens' use of social media. She explores tropes about identity, privacy, safety, danger, and bullying. Ultimately, boyd argues that society fails young people when paternalism and protectionism hinder teenagers’ ability to become informed, thoughtful, and engaged citizens through their online interactions. Yet despite an environment of rampant fear-mongering, boyd finds that teens often find ways to engage and to develop a sense of identity.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBoyd’s conclusions are essential reading not only for parents, teachers, and others who work with teens but also for anyone interested in the impact of emerging technologies on society, culture, and commerce in years to come. Offering insights gleaned from more than a decade of original fieldwork interviewing teenagers across the United States, boyd concludes reassuringly that the kids are all right. At the same time, she acknowledges that coming to terms with life in a networked era is not easy or obvious. In a technologically mediated world, life is bound to be complicated.\r\n\r\n<br /><a href=\"http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2014/03/03/its-complicated-open-access.html\">What's behind the free PDF</a>","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780300166439","urn:ISBN:9780300166316","urn:ISBN:9780300199000"],"id":130412,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=s6PNAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1119/?feed=opds","author":"danah boyd","isOwn":false},{"category":["Amusement parks","Boys","Fantasy","Fiction","In library","Protected DAISY","Race relations","School integration"],"updated":"2014-04-01T12:33:14","language":"en","title":"Dogland","issued":"1997-2002","summary":"Dogland is a fantasy novel by Will Shetterly, a fantasy and comic book writer.

It is by Stephan Kinsella who caused a worldwide rethinking among libertarians of the very basis of intellectual property. Mises had warned against patents, and Rothbard did too. But Kinsella goes much further to argue that the very existence of patents are contrary to a free market, and adds in here copyrights and trademarks too. They all use the state to create artificial scarcities of non-scarce goods and employ coercion in a way that is contrary to property rights and the freedom of contract.\r\n\r\nMany people who read this essay for the first time were unprepared for the rigor of his argument, which takes time to settle in simply because it seems so shocking at first. But Kinsella makes his case with powerful logic and examples that are overwhelming in their persuasive power.\r\n\r\nThe relevance in a digital age can’t be overstated. The state works with monopolistic private producers to inhibit innovation and stop the progress of technology, while using coercion against possible competitors and against consumers. Even U.S. foreign policy is profoundly affected by widespread confusions over what is legitimate and merely asserted as property. What Kinsella is calling for instead of this cartelizing system is nothing more or less than a pure free market, which he argues would not generate anything resembling what we call intellectual property today. IP, he argues, is really a state-enforce legal convention, not an extension of real ownership.\r\n\r\nFew essays written in the last decades have caused so much fundamental rethinking. It is essential that libertarians get this issue right, and understand the arguments on all sides. Kinsella’s piece here is masterful in making a case against IP that turns out to be more rigorous and thorough than any written on the left, right, or anything in between.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781933550329"],"id":137084,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/e5/02/e5026429d376e86777e262cd3a4111f6.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1257/?feed=opds","author":"Stephan Kinsella","isOwn":false},{"category":["Biography","Computer hackers","Computer programmers","Free Software Foundation (Cambridge, Mass.)","Open source software","Social conditions"],"updated":"2014-08-22T16:42:23","language":"en","title":"Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software","issued":"2001-2011","summary":"FREE AS IN FREEDOM interweaves biographical snapshots of GNU project founder RICHARD STALLMAN with the political, social and economic history of the free software movement. Starting with how it all began--a desire for software code from Xerox to make the printing more efficient--to the continuing quest for free software that exists today. It is a movement that Stallman has at turns defined, directed and manipulated. Like Alan Greenspan in the financial sector, Stallman has assumed the role of tribal elder in a community that bills itself as anarchic and immune to central authority. FREE AS IN FREEDOM looks at how the latest twists and turns in the software marketplace have done little to throw Stallman off his pedestal. Discover how the Richard's childhood and teenage experiences made him the man he is today. If anything, they have made Stallman's logic-based rhetoric and immovable personality more persuasive.

Chapter 1 outlines the conceptual meaning of the term “income” for uniquely tax purposes (as opposed to financial accounting or trust law purposes, for example) and examines the Internal Revenue Code provisions that translate this larger conceptual construct into positive law. Chapter 2 explores various forms of consumption taxation because the modern Internal Revenue Code is best perceived as a hybrid income-consumption tax that also contains many provisions—for wise or unwise nontax policy reasons—that are inconsistent with both forms of taxation. Chapter 3 then provides students with the story of how we got to where we are today, important context about the distribution of the tax burden, the budget, and economic trends, as well as material on ethical debates, economic theories, and politics as they affect taxation.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nArmed with this larger blueprint, students are then in a much better position to see how the myriad pieces that follow throughout the remaining 19 chapters fit into this bigger picture, whether comfortably or uncomfortably. For example, they are in a better position to appreciate how applying the income tax rules for debt to a debt-financed investment afforded more favorable consumption tax treatment creates tax arbitrage problems. Congress and the courts then must combat these tax shelter opportunities (sometimes ineffectively) with both statutory and common law weapons. Stated another way, students are in a better position to appreciate how the tax system can sometimes be used to generate (or combat) unfair and economically inefficient rent-seeking behavior. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis is the second version of this textbook, updated through January 2015.\r\n","id":144894,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2780/?feed=opds","author":"Deborah A.

The opener is designed to draw the student into the chapter and create an interest in learning about the topic.</li><li><strong>Psychology in everyday life.</strong>Each chapter contains one or two features designed to link the principles from the chapter to real-world applications in business, environment, health, law, learning, and other relevant domains.

Each chapter presents one or more close-ups on research — well-articulated and specific examples of research within the content area, each including a summary of the hypotheses, methods, results, and interpretations. This feature provides a continuous thread that reminds students of the importance of empirical research.

In this troubled, dangerous time, there is a man who has the privilege--and the curse--of belonging to both worlds. He is Gray Cloud, a disciple of the aging shaman Owl Carver. A handsome young half-breed, he is chosen by the Great Turtle to become the mystical leader of the Sauk people... and summoned by his French-born aristocratic father to inherit the vast estate of Victoire.Here is the riveting drama of Gray Cloud's transformation into the powerful shaman White Bear, and his desperate struggle to reconcile the opposing forces of his white and Indian heritage.

The authors argue for the wise integration of web tools into what the liberal arts does best: writing across the curriculum. All academic disciplines value clear and compelling prose, whether that prose comes in the shape of a persuasive essay, scientific report, or creative expression. The act of writing visually demonstrates how we think in original and critical ways and in ways that are deeper than those that can be taught or assessed by a computer. Furthermore, learning to write well requires engaged readers who encourage and challenge us to revise our muddled first drafts and craft more distinctive and informed points of view. Indeed, a new generation of web-based tools for authoring, annotating, editing, and publishing can dramatically enrich the writing process, but doing so requires liberal arts educators to rethink why and how we teach this skill, and to question those who blindly call for embracing or rejecting technology. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPurchase print editions at <a href=\"https://www.press.umich.edu/8291956/web_writing\">University of Michigan Press</a></p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780472121359","urn:ISBN:9780472072828","urn:ISBN:9780472052820","urn:ISBN:9780472900121"],"id":151675,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/da/f9/daf950f93b40527a97844095691380d9.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3050/?feed=opds","author":"Jack Dougherty (editor)","isOwn":false},{"category":["Geology","Nonfiction","Physical geography","Science","Science / Earth Sciences","Science / Earth Sciences / Geology","Textbooks"],"updated":"2015-10-20T12:59:32","language":"en","title":"Physical Geology","issued":"2015","summary":"<p>\r\n\tPhysical Geology is a comprehensive introductory text on the physical aspects of geology, including rocks and minerals, plate tectonics, earthquakes, volcanoes, glaciation, groundwater, streams, coasts, mass wasting, climate change, planetary geology and much more.

The full spectrum of symptoms is characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity, which is maladaptive and inconsistent with a comparable level of developmental age known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD is considered one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders and of childhood, and among the most prevalent chronic health conditions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven the wide heterogeneity and complex manifestations of the disorder, there is an importance in a developmental perspective that views ADHD as a multi-factorial disorder with multiple, causal processes, and pathways. The symptoms of ADHD should be cast, not as static or fixed neurobehavioral deficits, but rather in terms of underlying developmental processes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven experienced professional might minimize the prevalence of a disorder among certain groups of patients. Therefore, the existence of attention disorders might become &quot;transparent&quot; for both the patient and the professional. This might lead to a non-accurate diagnosis, harm the treatment aspects and has potential non beneficial prognostic aspects. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe developmental approach can provide predictions as to how characteristics associated with attention develop over time and how multiple risk and protective factors transact to impact it's development, as well as the development of a broad range of associated co-morbid features. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmong children with mental retardation, autistic spectrum disorders, children who were born premature, born with low birth weight, as well as among those who suffer from chronic disorders (such as epilepsy, diabetes, chronic kidney disease or asthma), as well as among otherwise healthy preschoolers – the assessment of attention performance might be very challenging. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this research topic, we explore the latest cutting edge research on the biological and neural pathways as well as on psychosocial and behavioral correlates of brain development and attention spectrum. In doing so we aim to highlight: what is currently known regarding this new conceptualization of attention as a spectrum; the mechanisms underlying this spectrum; and where this field is headed in terms of developing our understanding of the link between brain development and attention performance.</p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9782889195336"],"id":152450,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=MFpkCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3131/?feed=opds","author":"Itai Berger (editor)","isOwn":false},{"category":{"term":"18-","scheme":"http://schema.org/typicalAgeRange","label":"Adult/Advanced Reader"},"publishers":[{"publisher":"Open Book Publishers"}],"updated":"2015-11-25T21:45:35","language":"en","title":"Peace and Democratic Society","issued":"2011","summary":"<p>Recent acts of terrorism and the current unrest in the Middle East remind us how important it is to understand the relationship between violence, peace and democracy. In a challenging and insightful essay, Amartya Sen explores ideas around 'organised violence' (such as war, genocide and terrorism) and violence against the individual. Highlighting the inadequacies of some of the widely accepted explanations for violence—including the idea that the world is experiencing a 'clash of civilisations'—Sen makes a plea for a global, multilateral debate on the causes of conflict, and an understanding of the multiple identities of the individuals involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introductory essay draws on the findings of the Commonwealth Commission on Respect and Understanding, which was chaired by Sen, and established to promote mutual communication and understanding among all faiths and communities in the Commonwealth.

This book shows that category theory can be useful outside of mathematics as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language throughout the sciences. Information is inherently dynamic; the same ideas can be organized and reorganized in countless ways, and the ability to translate between such organizational structures is becoming increasingly important in the sciences. Category theory offers a unifying framework for information modeling that can facilitate the translation of knowledge between disciplines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWritten in an engaging and straightforward style, and assuming little background in mathematics, the book is rigorous but accessible to non-mathematicians. Using databases as an entry to category theory, it begins with sets and functions, then introduces the reader to notions that are fundamental in mathematics: monoids, groups, orders, and graphs—categories in disguise. After explaining the “big three” concepts of category theory—categories, functors, and natural transformations—the book covers other topics, including limits, colimits, functor categories, sheaves, monads, and operads.

Eliot's sophisticated and acute characterization gives rich expression to every nuance of feeling, and vividly brings to life the town's inhabitants--including the young idealist Dorothea Brooke, the dry scholar Casaubon, the young, passionate reformist doctor Lydgate, the flighty young beauty Rosamond, and the old, secretive banker Bulstrode--as they move in counterpoint to each other. Art, religion, politics, society, science, human relationships in all their complexity--nothing is left unexamined under the narrator's microscope.

So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip. I give Pirrip as my fathers family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my fathers, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, &quot;Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,&quot; I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine, who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle, I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence. Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip. &quot;Hold your noise!&quot; cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch. &quot;Keep still, you little devil, or Ill cut your throat!&quot; A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780760748633","urn:ISBN:9781466297609","urn:ISBN:9783446237605","urn:ISBN:9780717286690","urn:ISBN:9781851520398","urn:ISBN:9781561381708","urn:ISBN:9780141439563","urn:ISBN:9780140620160","urn:ISBN:9780486415864"],"id":66030,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=jn9-ygAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4555/?feed=opds","author":"Charles Dickens","isOwn":false},{"category":["B","GITenberg","Knowledge, Theory of","Literature","Nonfiction","Social conditions"],"updated":"2016-09-21T17:39:05","language":"en","title":"A treatise of human nature","issued":"1910-2011","summary":"A Treatise of Human Nature is a book by Scottish philosopher David Hume, first published in 1739–1740.\r\nThe full title of the Treatise is 'A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects'.

Noise can block or interfere with the meaning of a message in both human and electronic communication. But in Information Theory, noise is still considered to be information. By refining the definition of noise as that which addresses us outside of our preferred comfort zone, Joseph Nechvatal's Immersion Into Noise investigates multiple aspects of cultural noise by applying the audio understanding of noise to the visual, architectural and cognitive domains. Nechvatal expands and extends our understanding of the function of cultural noise by taking the reader through the immersive and phenomenal aspects of noise into algorithmic and network contexts, beginning with his experience in the Abside of the Grotte de Lascaux. Immersion Into Noise is intended as a conceptual handbook useful for the development of a personal-political-visionary art of noise. On a planet that is increasingly technologically linked and globally mediated, how might noises break and re-connect in distinctive and productive ways within practices located in the world of art and thought? That is the question Joseph Nechvatal explores in Immersion Into Noise.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781607852414"],"id":129354,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/6b/cc/6bcc59061bdcb6ec9f0658380f8bb152.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1059/?feed=opds","author":"Joseph Necvatal","isOwn":false},{"category":["Cyberspace","Fiction","Science Fiction"],"updated":"2014-04-04T09:51:57","language":"en","title":"Entropy of Imagination","issued":"2012","summary":"Trapped in a World Running Out of Ideas...\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThousands of years ago, before he was trapped on an isolated computer system, Flatline was programmed to conquer the world.

Why is five hundred years better than five months or five years as a planning horizon? And why is history - especially long-term history - so essential to understanding the multiple pasts which gave rise to our conflicted present? The History Manifesto is a call to arms to historians and everyone interested in the role of history in contemporary society. Leading historians David Armitage and Jo Guldi identify a recent shift back to longer-term narratives, following many decades of increasing specialization, which they argue is vital for the future of historical scholarship and how it is communicated.

North America lies in ruins beneath the thumb of an omnipotent psychopath. Digital monsters have taken Clarke's name, wreaking havoc throughout the decimated remnants of something that was once called Internet. Governments have fallen across the globe; warlords and suicide cults rise from the ashes, pledging fealty to the Meltdown Madonna. All because five years ago, Lenie Clarke had a score to settle.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBut she has learned something in the meantime: she destroyed the world for a fallacy.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNow, cowering at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, rifters and the technoindustrial &quot;corpses&quot; who created them hide from a world in its death throes. But they cannot hide forever: something is tracking them, down amongst the lightless cliffs and trenches of the Midatlantic Ridge. The consequences of past acts reach inexorably towards the very bottom of the world, and Lenie Clarke must finally confront the mess she made.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nRedemption doesn't come easy with the blood of a world on your hands. But even after five years in purgatory, Lenie Clarke is still Lenie Clarke. There will be consequences for anyone who gets in her way-and worse ones, perhaps, if she succeeds. . . .\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBehemoth was originally published in two volumes, <i>Behemoth: ß-max</i> and <i>Behemoth: Seppukku</i>.

Despite the ecopocalypse and social upheavals on Earth, humanity has conquered the solar system and partially terraformed Mars. Advancements in biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science have transformed our lives. Everyone is wirelessly networked with the world around them, AIs process vast amounts of information, and nano-fabrication enables people to “print” complex devices from the molecular level—at home. Biotechnology allows people to genefix, enhance, and clone their bodies, while others pursue body modifications to adapt to new environments or make themselves into something no longer quite human. People’s minds and memories can be digitized, uploaded, transferred over long distances, and downloaded into new bodies (biological or synthetic). Death has been defeated—for those who can afford it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom within, disaster struck. Transhumanity reaped the rewards of its arrogance when conflict spiked between the battered nations of Earth, already weakened by decades of climate catastrophes and other disruptive factors. Rampant netwars soon exploded into physical conflicts with spiraling body counts. In the midst of these aggressions, a group of military AIs known as TITANS quietly achieved full sentience and autonomy, and rapidly began exponentially incrementing their own intellectual growth. The AI intelligences spawned by this hard-takeoff singularity quickly turned against transhumanity, enveloping the system in unprecedented levels of violence, disaster, and warfare. What began as a whirlwind of conflict between political factions, revolutionaries, and hypercorps soon escalated into a struggle between man and machine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn just a few years, transhumanity was nearly wiped out with nuclear strikes, biowarfare plagues, destructive nanoswarms, infowar attacks, mass uploads, and other unexplained singularity events, ripping the superpowers of old to pieces. Our planetary home—Earth—was transformed into a toxic and strange hellhole, while many major habitats were left frozen sarcophagi in the vacuum of space. Just as quickly as they came, the TITANS disappeared, taking millions of uploaded minds with them, leaving behind a network of wormhole gateways. Known as Pandora Gates, these poorly-understood devices allow instantaneous teleportation to distant star systems—often one-way and/or fatal. Though only a handful of Pandora Gates are known to exist—each highly contested—the foolish, brave, curious, and desperate are already risking certain death to enter and explore what lies beyond.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the aftermath of the Fall, transhumanity lives on, divided into a patchwork of hypercorp combines, survivalist stations, transhuman faction species, and city-state habitats. Under the oppressive police states of immortal inner-system oligarchies, advanced technologies remain highly restricted, and refugee infomorphs are held in virtual slavery or resleeved in robotic bodies and forced into indentured labor. In the outer system, rebel transhuman scientists and techno-anarchists struggle to maintain a new society—from each according to their imagination and to each according to their need. And on the fringes and in the niches lurk networked tribes of political extremists, religious fanatics, criminal entrepeneurs, and bizarre posthumans, among other, stranger, and more alien things ...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThough most claim the Fall was carefully orchestrated by the out-of-control TITANS, others whisper that the driving powers behind the wars—both AI and transhuman—were infected by a mutating virus with multiple infection vectors—biological, information, nano—dubbed the Exsurgent virus. Whatever its source, this virus has been known to sometimes transform its victims into something unexplainable ... something monstrous and reality-altering. Whatever the truth, the remnants of the TITANS and this virus were left to the desolated ruins or driven to the edges of the system, where they remain hidden away in dark corners, quietly waiting to infect the minds of the scavengers and explorers who find them ... </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hard and softcover avilable at <a href=\"http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=64135&amp;affiliate_id=50261&amp;src=EPReleasesPage\">DriveThruRPG</a>; many resources at <a href=\"http://www.eclipsephase.com/resources\">EclipsePhase.com</a></p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781934857168","urn:ISBN:9780984583508"],"id":155525,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=WGWXQAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3264/?feed=opds","author":"Lars Blumenstein","isOwn":false},{"category":["Creative writing (Higher education)","Education","Education / Philosophy & Social Aspects","Writing","Yoga"],"updated":"2016-02-01T15:38:03","language":"en","title":"Yoga Minds, Writing Bodies: Contemplative Writing Pedagogy","issued":"2015","summary":"<p>In <em>Yoga Minds, Writing Bodies</em>, Christy Wenger argues for the inclusion of Eastern-influenced contemplative education within writing studies. She observes that, although we have &quot;embodied&quot; writing education in general by discussing the rhetorics of racialized, gendered, and disabled bodies, we have done substantially less to address the particular bodies that occupy our classrooms. She proposes that we turn to contemplative education practices that engages student bodies through fusing a traditional curriculum with contemplative practices including yoga, meditation, and the martial arts. Drawing strength from the recent &quot;quiet revolution&quot; (Zajonc) of contemplative pedagogy within postsecondary education and a legacy of field interest attributable to James Moffett, this project draws on case studies of first-year college writers to present contemplative pedagogy as a means of teaching students mindfulness of their writing and learning in ways that promote the academic, rhetorical work accomplished in first-year composition classes while at the same time remaining committed to a larger scope of a writer's physical and emotional well-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Available in paperback and hardcover <a href=\"http://www.parlorpress.com/yoga_minds_writing_bodies\">from Parlor Press</a>.</p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781602356610","urn:ISBN:9781602356603"],"id":155613,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=Vk7urQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3270/?feed=opds","author":"Christy I.

His fresh consideration of the era of the New Economic Policy and cultural politics after the Revolution explains how new communist institutions rose to parallel and rival conventional higher learning from the Academy of Sciences to the universities. Beginning with the creation of the first party school by intellectuals on the island of Capri in 1909, David-Fox argues, the Bolshevik cultural project was tightly linked to party educational institutions. He provides the first account of the early history and politics of three major institutions founded after the Revolution: Sverdlov Communist University, where the quest to transform everyday life gripped the student movement; the Institute of Red Professors, where the Bolsheviks sought to train a new communist intellectual or red specialist; and the Communist Academy, headquarters for a planned, collectivist, proletarian science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Print edition available from <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100205800\">Cornell University Press</a>.</p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780801431289","urn:ISBN:9781501707179"],"id":193797,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/85/cd/85cdc9a58ca160550d31e85bf4257d4d.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/18515/?feed=opds","author":"Michael David-Fox","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Adventure and adventurers","Adventure and adventurers in fiction","Adventure stories","American Personal narratives","Atlantic Ocean -- Fiction","British","British in fiction","Castaways","Castaways -- Fiction","Castaways in fiction","Children's literature, English","Children's stories, English","Chinese","Classic Literature","Composition and exercises","Crusoe, Robinson (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","English Adventure stories","English language","Esperanto","Fantasy","Fiction","Fiction in Spanish","GITenberg","High interest-low vocabulary books","Illustrated children's books","Imaginary Voyages","In library","Islands","Islands -- Fiction","Islands in fiction","Juvenile Fiction","Juvenile literature","Large type books","Literature","OverDrive","Pirates","Pirates in fiction","Plague","Popular Print Disabled Books","PR","Protected DAISY","Publishers' binding","Readers","Relatos de aventura","Report writing","Robinson Crusoe (Fictitious character)","Robinson Cusoe","Robinsonades","Shipwreck survival","Shipwreck survival -- Fiction","Shipwrecks","Shipwrecks in fiction","Solitude","Solitude in fiction","Specimens","Supervivencia (después de accidentes aéreos, naufragios, etc.)","Survival","Survival after airplane accidents, shipwrecks","Survival after airplane accidents, shipwrecks, etc. in fiction","Survival and emergency equipment","Survival in fiction","Textbooks for foreign speakers","Texts","Toy and movable books","Travelers","Travelers in fiction","World War, 1939-1945"],"publishers":[{"publisher":"Recovering the Classics"}],"updated":"2016-07-27T17:27:34","language":"en","title":"Robinson Crusoe","issued":"1719-2012","summary":" This is an OCR edition with typos.

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had been just recommending to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt: in a word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to give me any encouragement to go away: and to close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his youn...","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780448058214","urn:ISBN:9789510113790","urn:ISBN:9780430000641","urn:ISBN:9780027264609","urn:ISBN:9789631127874","urn:ISBN:9783800046065","urn:ISBN:9783785525142","urn:ISBN:9789683302014","urn:ISBN:9780689851049"],"id":64790,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=3DljuAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4777/?feed=opds","author":"Daniel Defoe","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Art teachers","Art teachers -- Fiction","Classic Literature","Country homes","Country homes -- Fiction","Deception","Deception -- Fiction","England","England -- Fiction","English Detective and mystery stories","English language","Fiction","Foreign speakers","Fraud","GITenberg","Gothic fiction (Literary genre)","In library","Inheritance and succession","Inheritance and succession -- Fiction","Love stories","Nobility","Nobility -- Fiction","OverDrive","PR","Protected DAISY","Psychiatric hospital patients","Psychiatric hospital patients -- Fiction","Psychological fiction","Readers (Secondary)","Social life and customs","Study and teaching (Secondary)","Swindlers and swindling","Young women"],"updated":"2016-07-27T12:19:33","language":"en","title":"The woman in white","issued":"1860-2011","summary":"The Woman in White, by Wilkie Collins, is part of the Barnes &amp; Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes &amp; Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices &amp; Glossaries, when appropriateAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes &amp; Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. One of the greatest mystery thrillers ever written, Wilkie Collins’s The Woman in White was a phenomenal bestseller in the 1860s, achieving even greater success than works by Dickens, Collins’s friend and mentor. Full of surprise, intrigue, and suspense, this vastly entertaining novel continues to enthrall readers today. The story begins with an eerie midnight encounter between artist Walter Hartright and a ghostly woman dressed all in white who seems desperate to share a dark secret. The next day Hartright, engaged as a drawing master to the beautiful Laura Fairlie and her half sister, tells his pupils about the strange events of the previous evening. Determined to learn all they can about the mysterious woman in white, the three soon find themselves drawn into a chilling vortex of crime, poison, kidnapping, and international intrigue. Masterfully constructed, The Woman in White is dominated by two of the finest creations in all Victorian fiction—Marion Halcombe, dark, mannish, yet irresistibly fascinating, and Count Fosco, the sinister and flamboyant “Napoleon of Crime.” Camille Cauti earned a Ph.D. in English from Columbia University. Her dissertation concerns the Catholic conversion trend among the London avant-garde of the 1890s. She has also published articles in Italian-American studies. She works in New York City as an editor and critic.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780141439617","urn:ISBN:9780375759062","urn:ISBN:9780140430967","urn:ISBN:9780553212631","urn:ISBN:9780199535637","urn:ISBN:9780192834294","urn:ISBN:9781853260773","urn:ISBN:9780486440965","urn:ISBN:9780141192420"],"id":64803,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=2tDt4VlJ-tQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4471/?feed=opds","author":"Wilkie Collins","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Antique dealers","Antique dealers -- Fiction","Classic Literature","Didactic fiction","Domestic fiction","England -- Fiction","Fiction","Gamblers","Gamblers -- Fiction","Gambling","Girls","Girls -- Fiction","GITenberg","Grandfathers","Grandfathers -- Fiction","Grandparent and child","Grandparent and child -- Fiction","In library","Literature","Loss (Psychology)","OverDrive","PR","Protected DAISY","Social life and customs","Translations into Russian"],"updated":"2016-08-06T19:27:49","language":"en","title":"The Old Curiosity Shop","issued":"1953-2010","summary":"One of Dickens's most haunting and bizarre novels, The Old Curiosity Shop is the story of &quot;Little Nell&quot; and her persecution by the grotesque and lecherous Quilp. It is a shifting kaleidoscope of events and characters as the story reaches its tragic climax, an ending that famously devastated the novel's earliest readers. Dickens blends naturalistic and allegorical styles to encompass both the actual blight of Victorian industrialization and textual echoes of Bunyan, the Romantic poets, Shakespeare, pantomine, and Jacobean tragedy. This edition uses the Clarendon text, the definitive edition of the novels of Charles Dickens, and includes the original illustrations.

The views of Hamilton, Madison and Jay expressed in this landmark work have had a lasting effect on U.S. Constitutional law. Eighty-five of the essays were almost entirely written by Hamilton and Madison, and probably only five were written by Jay. Most of the individual essays appeared under the collective pseudonym &quot;Publius&quot; in New York newspapers and journals from October 27, 1787 to early June 1788. The first edition was published anonymously and printed by the M'Lean brothers, who collected and published the first 36 essays as Volume I in March, 1788, with the final 49 essays in Volume II in May of the same year, along with the text of the Constitution. The essays were intended to encourage ratification of the proposed constitution by New York State, but were immediately recognized as the most compelling commentary on the most radical form of government the world had seen.

One of the first and still finest spy stories ever written, &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; introduced Edwardian readers to the idea of a 'secret service'. In an enthralling tale of a duel among the islands and sandbanks of the North Sea, two amateur investigators and yachtsmen discover sinister preparations off the German coast. At great peril both from an implacable enemy and furious storms at sea, they stake their lives on the strength of their doughty boat, the Dulcibella. Will they fight their way back to England in time to sound a warning? &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; caused a sensation when it appeared in1903, with statesmen and soldiers drawn into a debate about Britain's readiness to repulse a naval invasion. So strong was its impact that one critic later accused its author of almost single-handedly starting a European war. The influence of &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; would not have been so great if it had not been so powerfully readable, a quality it keeps to this day. Ranked with the greatest work of John Buchan, Joseph Conrad and Ian Fleming, this vintage adventure by Erskine Childers has lost nothing of its force.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781574090154","urn:ISBN:9780246110411","urn:ISBN:9780140621433","urn:ISBN:9780812966145","urn:ISBN:9780140009057","urn:ISBN:9781853260384","urn:ISBN:9780141181653","urn:ISBN:9780141031279","urn:ISBN:9780486408798"],"id":66173,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=fsORyNg_HWMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10623/?feed=opds","author":"Erskine Childers","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Adultery","Adultery -- Fiction","Charles Bovary (Fictitious character)","Classic Literature","Country life","Critique et interprétation","Domestic fiction","Emma Bovary (Fictitious character)","English fiction","Fiction","Fiction in English","Fiction in Spanish","France -- Fiction","French fiction","GITenberg","History","Husband and wife","In library","Intellectual life","Large type books","Literature","Married women","Married women -- Fiction","Middle class","Middle class -- Fiction","NOVELAS FRANCESAS","OverDrive","Physicians","Physicians' spouses","Physicians' spouses -- Fiction","PQ","Protected DAISY","Social life and customs","Spouses","Suicide","Suicide victims","Suicide victims -- Fiction","Technique","Translations from French","Translations into English","Women"],"publishers":[{"publisher":"Recovering the Classics"}],"updated":"2016-07-27T17:27:27","language":"en","title":"Madame Bovary","issued":"1928-2011","summary":" Excerpt: VII.

Strange, therefore, as may seem to us the idea of a god incarnate in human form, it has nothing very startling for early man, who sees in a man-god or a god-man only a higher degree of the same supernatural powers which he arrogates in perfect good faith to himself. -from &quot;Chapter VII: Incarnate Human Gods&quot; In 1890, James George Frazer began publishing The Golden Bough, his monumental study of myth, ritual, and religion, which would, by 1936, run to 13 volumes and establish him as a pioneer in the study of religion as an aspect of culture. This abridged edition, assembled in 1922, condenses this fundamental work to one readable volume that is still a source for modern anthropology, thanks to its expansive discussions ancient cultish practices and their connections to the rites of modern Christianity. In eloquent prose, Frazer discusses legends of the woods, sympathetic magic, magicians as kings, the worship of trees, the concept of the sacred marriage, the links between priestly and royal power, ritual royal sacrifices, the concept of &quot;eating the god,&quot; the myths of Osiris, Adonis, Isis, and other ancient deities, and much more. Lovers of mythology will be enraptured by this book, which draws all of human belief under one unifying umbrella, celebrating myth and ritual as part of the basis of all human culture. Scottish anthropologist SIR JAMES GEORGE FRAZER (1854-1941) also wrote Man, God, and Immortality (1927) and Creation and Evolution in Primitive Cosmogonies (1935).","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780684826301","urn:ISBN:9781853263101","urn:ISBN:9780020955702","urn:ISBN:9780192835413","urn:ISBN:9780517336335","urn:ISBN:9780684818504","urn:ISBN:9780140189315","urn:ISBN:9780199538829","urn:ISBN:9780333096291"],"id":66688,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=pRDqoO_5HhEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14071/?feed=opds","author":"James George Frazer","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Bildungsromans","Children of divorced parents","Children of divorced parents -- Fiction","Classic Literature","Domestic fiction","Fiction","Girls","Girls -- Fiction","GITenberg","Governesses","Governesses -- Fiction","In library","Literature","OverDrive","Protected DAISY","PS","Remarried people","Remarried people -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-07-27T13:56:52","language":"en","title":"What Maisie knew","issued":"1966-2010","summary":" This is an OCR edition with typos. Excerpt from book: been no end of them about ? that I will say for her!&quot; Maisie felt bewildered and was afterwards for some time conscious of a vagueness, just slightly embarrassing, as to the subject of so much amusement and as to where her governess had really been. She did n't feel at all as if she had been seriously told, and no such feeling was supplied by anything that occurred later. Her embarrassment, of a precocious instinctive order, attached itself to the idea that this was another of the matters it was not for her, as her mother used to say, to go into. Therefore, under her father's roof during the time that followed, she made no attempt to clear up her ambiguity by an ingratiating way with housemaids; and it was an odd truth that the ambiguity itself took nothing from the fresh pleasure promised her by renewed contact with Miss Overmore. The confidence looked for by that young lady was of the fine sort that explanation can't improve, and she herself at any rate was a person superior to any confusion. For Maisie moreover concealment had never necessarily seemed deception; she had grown up among things as to which her foremost knowledge was that she was never to ask about them. It was far from new to her that the questions of the small are the peculiar diversion of the great: except the affairs of her doll Lisette there had scarcely ever been anything at her mother's that was explicable with a grave face. Nothing was so easy to her as to send the ladies who gathered there off into shrieks, and she might have practised upon them largely if she had been of a more calculating turn. Everything had something behind it: life was like a long, long corridor with rows of closed doors.

Cohen and Tom Scheinfeldt posted the following provocative questions online:\r\n\r\n“Can an algorithm edit a journal? Can a library exist without books? Can students build and manage their own learning management platforms? Can a conference be held without a program? Can Twitter replace a scholarly society?”\r\n\r\nAs recently as the mid-2000s, questions like these would have been unthinkable. But today serious scholars are asking whether the institutions of the academy as they have existed for decades, even centuries, aren’t becoming obsolete. Every aspect of scholarly infrastructure is being questioned, and even more importantly, being hacked. Sympathetic scholars of traditionally disparate disciplines are canceling their association memberships and building their own networks on Facebook and Twitter. Journals are being compiled automatically from self-published blog posts. Newly minted PhDs are forgoing the tenure track for alternative academic careers that blur the lines between research, teaching, and service. Graduate students are looking beyond the categories of the traditional CV and building expansive professional identities and popular followings through social media. Educational technologists are “punking” established technology vendors by rolling out their own open source infrastructure.\r\n\r\nHere, in Hacking the Academy, Daniel J. Cohen and Tom Scheinfeldt have gathered a sampling of the answers to their initial questions from scores of engaged academics who care deeply about higher education. These are the responses from a wide array of scholars, presenting their thoughts and approaches with a vibrant intensity, as they explore and contribute to ongoing efforts to rebuild scholarly infrastructure for a new millennium.\r\n\r\n- See more at: http://www.press.umich.edu/3981059/hacking_the_academy","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780472029471","urn:ISBN:9780472071982","urn:ISBN:9780472051984","urn:ISBN:9780472900251"],"id":129355,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/5f/f5/5ff58fab158d7291e16e81a4cb14eb38.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1064/?feed=opds","author":"Daniel J.

The phenomenon he describes as social production is reshaping markets, while at the same time offering new opportunities to enhance individual freedom, cultural diversity, political discourse, and justice. But these results are by no means inevitable: a systematic campaign to protect the entrenched industrial information economy of the last century threatens the promise of today’s emerging networked information environment.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn this comprehensive social theory of the Internet and the networked information economy, Benkler describes how patterns of information, knowledge, and cultural production are changing—and shows that the way information and knowledge are made available can either limit or enlarge the ways people can create and express themselves. He describes the range of legal and policy choices that confront us and maintains that there is much to be gained—or lost—by the decisions we make today. \r\n<br /><br /> A <a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/wealth_of_networks/Main_Page\">Wiki at cyber.law.harvard.edu</a> serves as an invitation to collaborate on building a learning and research environment based on the book.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780300110562","urn:ISBN:9780300125771","urn:ISBN:9780300127232","urn:ISBN:9781281740809"],"id":20775,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=X0Q0mAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2336/?feed=opds","author":"Yochai Benkler","isOwn":false},{"category":["Chemistry","Nonfiction","Science","Textbooks"],"updated":"2014-10-14T14:47:22","language":"en","title":"CK-12 Chemistry - Second Edition","issued":"2011","summary":"CK-12 Chemistry covers Matter, Atomic Structure; The Elements and Their Properties; Stoichiometry; Chemical Kinetics; Physical States of Matter; Thermodynamics; Nuclear Chemistry; and Organic Chemistry.<br /><br />To access a customizable version of this book, as well as other interactive content, visit <a href=\"http://www.ck12.org\">www.ck12.org</a>","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781935983491"],"id":140345,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=OuVvV0-1dfsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2349/?feed=opds","author":"Sharon Bewick","isOwn":false},{"category":["Nonfiction","Software"],"updated":"2014-11-07T12:19:58","language":"en","title":"Open Advice.

WJC leaders supported the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine but did not see it as an end in itself. They strove to establish a Jewish state and to rehabilitate Diaspora Jewish life, two goals they saw as mutually complementary. The efforts of the WJC are put into the context of the serious difficulties facing the American Jewish community and its representative institutions during and after the war, as they tried to act as an ethnic minority within American society.

Lenie Clarke, in a black wetsuit, walks out of the ocean onto a Pacific Northwest beach filled with the oppressed and drugged homeless of the Asian world who have gotten only this far in their attempt to reach America. Is she a monster, or a goddess? One thing is for sure: all hell is breaking loose.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis dark, fast-paced, hard SF novel returns to the story begun in Starfish: all human life is threatened by a disease (actually a primeval form of life) from the distant prehuman past. It survived only in the deep ocean rift where Clarke and her companions were stationed before the corporation that employed them tried to sterilize the threat with a secret underwater nuclear strike. But Clarke was far enough away that she was able to survive and tough enough to walk home, 300 miles across the ocean floor. She arrives carrying with her the potential death of the human race, and possessed by a desire for revenge. Maelstrom is a terrifying explosion of cyberpunk noir by a writer whose narrative, says Robert Sheckley, &quot;drives like a futuristic locomotive.&quot;\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis is the second novel in the Rifters trilogy:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://unglue.it/work/5486/\">Starfish</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://unglue.it/work/5485/\">Maelstrom</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://unglue.it/work/145864/\">Behemoth</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nRead online at <a href=\"http://www.rifters.com/real/MAELSTROM.htm\">rifters.com</a>","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780312878061","urn:ISBN:9780765320537","urn:ISBN:9780812566796"],"id":5485,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=bAgeIxgectoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2871/?feed=opds","author":"Peter Watts","isOwn":false},{"category":["Aunts","Fiction","In library","Interpersonal relations","Protected DAISY"],"updated":"2015-07-25T13:24:40","language":"en","title":"Family Resemblances","issued":"1986-1988","summary":"Fifteen-year-old Karen, upset by the loss of a boyfriend and her parents rocky marriage, spends a hot summer vacation with her Aunt Augusta, an eccentric English teacher, in a small Midwestern town and learns many things about love, life, and growing up.

This engaging and interactive textbook will enhance your ability to be successful in academics or a career in criminal justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Criminal Law</em> uses a two-step process to augment learning, called the applied approach. First, after building a strong foundation from scratch, <em>Criminal Law</em> introduces you to crimes and defenses that have been broken down into separate components. It is so much easier to memorize and comprehend the subject matter when it is simplified this way. However, becoming proficient in the law takes more than just memorization. You must be trained to take the laws you have studied and apply them to various fact patterns. Most students are expected to do this automatically, but application must be seen, experienced, and practiced before it comes naturally. Thus the second step of the applied approach is reviewing examples of the application of law to facts after dissecting and analyzing each legal concept. Some of the examples come from cases, and some are purely fictional. All the examples are memorable, even quirky, so they will stick in your mind and be available when you need them the most (like during an exam). After a few chapters, you will notice that you no longer obsess over an explanation that doesn’t completely make sense the first time you read it—you will just skip to the example. The examples clarify the principles for you, lightening the workload significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Current versions including print are available via the <a href=\"http://educationbystorm.com/\">author's web site</a>.</p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781483433837","urn:ISBN:9781453324127"],"id":157260,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/c2/32/c232ae24ca1662e4299470ec493a6111.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3548/?feed=opds","author":"Lisa Storm","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","Fiction / Technological","Right of Privacy","Young Adult Fiction"],"updated":"2016-04-02T12:31:37","language":"en","title":"If Then Else","issued":"2016","summary":"<p>What are you going to do when your doofus of a big brother gets himself arrested on a terrorism charge?

Drawing on extensive archival research to explore the history of Poland's revolutionary upheavals, Blobaum departs from traditional interpretations of these events as peripheral to an essentially Russian movement that reached a climax in the Russian Revolution of 1917.

Together with &quot;My Antonia,&quot; &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; is the novel for which Cather is best known. The story in &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; takes place on the plains of Nebraska in the late 19th century. During that time, the prairie was settled by Swedish, Bohemian, and French immigrants trying to eke out a living from a harsh and often inhospitable land. The heroine of &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; is Alexandra Bergson, who inherits her father's farm as a young woman, raises his three sons and stays with the farm through the harsh times to become a successful landowner and farmer. &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; speaks of being wedded to the land and to place. In this sense it is an instance of the American dream of a home. It speaks of a strong woman, and is a story as well of thwarted love, of the difficult nature of sexuality, and of human passion. There is also the beginning of what in Cather's works will become an increased sense of religion, Catholicism in particular, as a haven and a solace for the sorrow she finds at the heart of human endeavor. Above all it is a picture of stark life in the Midwest. There is almost as much blood-letting in &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; as in an Elizabethan tragedy. Willa Cather's picture of American life on the plains, even in her earliest books, is not an easy or simple one. Though some readers may quarrel with the seemingly happy ending of the book, none will deny that Alexandra's happiness is both bittersweet and dearly bought. Overall, &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; is a thoughtful, well written story of immigrant life on the plains and of the sorrow pain, and strength of the American experience.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140390704","urn:ISBN:9780199552320","urn:ISBN:9780679743620","urn:ISBN:9780395083659","urn:ISBN:9780486277851","urn:ISBN:9781406844351","urn:ISBN:9781449530198","urn:ISBN:9780895773548","urn:ISBN:9780553213584"],"id":13860,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=1Ld8PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4880/?feed=opds","author":"Willa Cather","isOwn":false},{"category":["Communism","GITenberg","HX","Literature","Nonfiction","Social conditions","Socialism"],"updated":"2016-07-27T14:42:42","language":"en","title":"The Communist manifesto","issued":"1955-2012","summary":"Critically and textually up-to-date, this new edition of the classic translation (Samuel Moore, 1888) features an introduction and notes by the eminent Marx scholar David McLellan, prefaces written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels subsequent to the original 1848 publication, and corrections of errors made in earlier versions.

From the stench of the killing-beds to the horrors of the fertilizer-works, the appalling conditions in which Jurgis works are described in intense detail by an author bent on social reform. So powerful was the book's message that it caught the eye of President Theodore Roosevelt and led to changes to the food hygiene laws. In his Introduction to this new edition, Russ Castronovo highlights the aesthetic concerns that were central to Sinclair's aspirations, examining the relationship between history and historical fiction, and between the documentary impulse and literary narrative. As he examines the book's disputed status as novel (it is propaganda or literature?), he reveals why Sinclair's message-driven fiction has relevance to literary and historical matters today, now more than a hundred years after the novel first appeared in print.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780534521790","urn:ISBN:9780252014949","urn:ISBN:9780743487627","urn:ISBN:9780553212457","urn:ISBN:9781593080082","urn:ISBN:9780140390315","urn:ISBN:9780451524201","urn:ISBN:9780486419237","urn:ISBN:9781593081645"],"id":62632,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=OouYPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4771/?feed=opds","author":"Upton Sinclair","isOwn":false},{"category":["Animal experimentation -- Fiction","Children's literature, English","Fiction","GITenberg","Islands -- Fiction","Literature","PR","Science Fiction","Shipwreck survival -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-05T22:42:08","language":"en","title":"The Island of Dr. Moreau","issued":"18??-2012","summary":"Title: The Island of Doctor Moreau.Publisher: British Library, Historical Print EditionsThe British Library is the national library of the United Kingdom.

One of the most influential books ever published in America, W. E. B. Du Bois’s The Souls of Black Folk is an eloquent collection of fourteen essays that describe the life, the ambitions, the struggles, and the passions of African Americans at the transition from the nineteenth to the twentieth century. The first African American to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard University, Du Bois was a sociologist, historian, novelist, and activist whose astounding career spanned the nation’s history from Reconstruction to the Civil Rights Movement. In The Souls of Black Folk, published in 1903, Du Bois argued against the conciliatory position taken by Booker T. Washington, at the time the most influential black leader in America, and called for a more radical form of aggressive protest—a strategy that would anticipate and inspire much of the activism of the 1960s. Du Bois’s essays were the first to articulate many of Black America’s thoughts and feelings, including the dilemma posed by the black psyche’s “double consciousness,” which Du Bois described as “this twoness—an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings . . . in one dark body.” Every essay in The Souls of Black Folk is a jewel of intellectual prowess, eloquent language, and groundbreaking insight. It is essential reading for anyone interested in the struggle for Civil Rights in America.

It is widely regarded as a significant work of English literature and part of the Western canon. The story tells of Charles Marlow, an Englishman who took a foreign assignment from a Belgian trading company as a ferry-boat captain in Africa. Heart of Darkness exposes the myth behind colonization while exploring the three levels of darkness that the protagonist, Marlow, encounters--the darkness of the Congo wilderness, the darkness of the European's cruel treatment of the natives, and the unfathomable darkness within every human being for committing heinous acts of evil. Although Conrad does not give the name of the river, at the time of writing the Congo Free State, the location of the large and important Congo River, was a private colony of Belgium's King Leopold II. Marlow is employed to transport ivory downriver. However, his more pressing assignment is to return Kurtz, another ivory trader, to civilization, in a cover-up. Kurtz has a reputation throughout the region. This symbolic story is a story within a story or frame narrative. It follows Marlow as he recounts from dusk through to late night, to a group of men aboard a ship anchored in the Thames Estuary his Congolese adventure. The passage of time and the darkening sky during the fictitious narrative-within-the-narrative parallel the atmosphere of the story.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9788073633073","urn:ISBN:9780863112348","urn:ISBN:9780486264646","urn:ISBN:9781580495752","urn:ISBN:9781599869506","urn:ISBN:9780141182438","urn:ISBN:9781892295491","urn:ISBN:9780140186529","urn:ISBN:9780140431681"],"id":64792,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=pGDpXwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5843/?feed=opds","author":"Joseph Conrad","isOwn":false},{"category":[" 20th century","Conspiracies","Fiction","GITenberg","Great Britain in fiction","Hannay, Richard (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","Intelligence service -- Great Britain -- Fiction","PR","Prejudices","Spies in fiction","Spy stories","World War, 1914-1918 -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T17:47:02","language":"en","title":"The 39 Steps","issued":"1915-2011","summary":"","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780192839312","urn:ISBN:9780750904827","urn:ISBN:9780141441177","urn:ISBN:9780140621099","urn:ISBN:9781853260803","urn:ISBN:9780486282015","urn:ISBN:9780141033730","urn:ISBN:9780140282627","urn:ISBN:9780140011302"],"id":99999,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=u3t0VzbbzGMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5939/?feed=opds","author":"John Buchan","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","British","British -- Europe -- Fiction","England -- Fiction","Female friendship","Female friendship -- Fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Governesses","In library","Literature","Married women","Married women -- Fiction","PR","Protected DAISY","Satire","Social classes","Social classes -- Fiction","Social conditions","Social life and customs","Waterloo, Battle of, Waterloo, Belgium, 1815 -- Fiction","Women"],"updated":"2016-08-06T18:21:52","language":"en","title":"Vanity Fair","issued":"1848-2012","summary":"The Four Corners Familiarsseries invites contemporary artists to illustrate and produce a new edition of a classic novel or short story.

Urquhart's drawings, inspired by the fashions and iconography of 1930s Hollywood, focus exclusively on Becky Sharp. &quot;I wanted to sideline all the secondary characters,&quot; says Urquhart.

Though no longer a household name, his works (particularly his fairy tales and fantasy novels) have inspired deep admiration in such notables as W. H. Auden, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Madeleine L'Engle. C. S. Lewis wrote that he regarded MacDonald as his &quot;master.&quot; Even Mark Twain, who initially despised MacDonald, became friends with him. MacDonald grew up influenced by his Congregational Church, with an atmosphere of Calvinism. But MacDonald never felt comfortable with some aspects of Calvinist doctrine. Later novels, such as Robert Falconer (1868) and Lilith (1895), show a distaste for the Calvinist idea that God's electing love is limited to some and denied to others. Especially in his Unspoken Sermons (1867-89) he shows a highly developed theology. His best-known works are Phantastes (1858), At the Back of the North Wind (1871) and The Princess and the Goblin (1872), all fantasy novels, and fairy tales such as - The Light Princess (1867), The Golden Key (1867), and The Wise Woman (1875).","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140367461","urn:ISBN:9780140302202","urn:ISBN:9780679428107","urn:ISBN:9780688066048","urn:ISBN:9780060095529","urn:ISBN:9780590440257","urn:ISBN:9780140350296","urn:ISBN:9781857159196","urn:ISBN:9780486407876"],"id":65212,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=swH5oHJrh5UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6332/?feed=opds","author":"George MacDonald","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Adaptations","Bildungsromans","Boys","Boys -- Fiction","Children's literature, English","Classic Literature","Criminals","Criminals -- Fiction","Description and travel","English language","Fiction","German language","GITenberg","History","Identity (Psychology)","In library","Kidnapping victims","Kidnapping victims -- Fiction","Large type books","Literature","London (England)","London (England) -- Fiction","Orphans","Orphans -- Fiction","OverDrive","Poor","Poor children","PR","Protected DAISY","Readers","Readers for new literates","Robbers and outlaws","Social life and customs","Textbooks for foreign speakers","Thieves"],"updated":"2016-07-13T19:34:53","language":"en","title":"Oliver Twist","issued":"1837-2012","summary":"Oliver Twist, by Charles Dickens, is part of the Barnes &amp; Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

One of Dickens’s most popular novels, Oliver Twist is the story of a young orphan who dares to say, &quot;Please, sir, I want some more.&quot; After escaping from the dark and dismal workhouse where he was born, Oliver finds himself on the mean streets of Victorian-era London and is unwittingly recruited into a scabrous gang of scheming urchins. In this band of petty thieves Oliver encounters the extraordinary and vibrant characters who have captured readers’ imaginations for more than 150 years: the loathsome Fagin, the beautiful and tragic Nancy, the crafty Artful Dodger, and perhaps one of the greatest villains of all time—the terrifying Bill Sikes. Rife with Dickens’s disturbing descriptions of street life, the novel is buoyed by the purity of the orphan Oliver. Though he is treated with cruelty and surrounded by coarseness for most of his life, his pious innocence leads him at last to salvation—and the shocking discovery of his true identity.

Before then, the language of the Court and aristocracy had been French, and the language of the University and Church was Latin. In that same year, Geoffrey Chaucer, a young man in the court of the King, began to translate poetry from French into English.

M. Forster, depicts a young Englishwoman's adventure trying to come to grips with the conflict between her desires and society's expectations. Lucy Honeychurch is a well-bred young middle class girl on holiday in radiant Florence. As E. M. Forster tells it, Lucy comes from a family which is overly concerned with respectability, and is over-protected by a spinster named Charlotte Bartlett. Under no circumstances will Miss Bartlett allow Lucy to pursue (or even examine) her affection for the handsome young George Emerson--his father is far too unconventional with his modern notions about honesty and freethinking. Determined to forget George, Lucy finally gives in to the repeated proposals of Cecil Vyse, a thoroughly fashionable young gentleman, if not very exciting. And so E. M. Forster sets the stage for &quot;A Room with a View,&quot; a splendid satire on the English social strata of the early part of the 20th century when the formal social structure of the Victorian era was beginning to fray at the edges. Vyse is a delightfully drawn male chauvinist; nobody likes him, but everyone is willing to accept him, and Lucy convinces herself that she is in love with him. However, Vyse's own penchant for getting his way by playing rather cruel practical jokes brings the Emersons back into the picture. Confronted by the contrast between the not quite classy but intelligent, thoughtful (and bold) George Emerson and the arrogant, boorish, but elite Cecil Vyse, Lucy finally decides to live as she plays Beethoven, with exciting results. E. M. Forster writes gently and calmly, but with a passion for life and love welling up beneath the surface. &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is a lovely book, vital with the force of a sensitive and empathetic mind. Highly recommended!","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9788792503930","urn:ISBN:9780582512641","urn:ISBN:9780553213232","urn:ISBN:9780140010596","urn:ISBN:9781440417818","urn:ISBN:9780141183299","urn:ISBN:9780486284675","urn:ISBN:9780140180787","urn:ISBN:9780735105928"],"id":66605,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=A3-xtwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4543/?feed=opds","author":"E.

H. Lawrence published in 1920. It is a sequel to his earlier novel The Rainbow (1915), and follows the continuing loves and lives of the Brangwen sisters, Gudrun and Ursula. Gudrun Brangwen, an artist, pursues a destructive relationship with Gerald Crich, an industrialist. David Herbert Richards Lawrence (1885-1930) was a very important and controversial English writer of the 20th century, whose prolific and diverse output included novels, short stories, poems, plays, essays, travel books, paintings, translations, literary criticism and personal letters. His collected works represent an extended reflection upon the dehumanizing effects of modernity and industrialisation. In them, Lawrence confronts issues relating to emotional health and vitality, spontaneity, sexuality, and instinctive behaviour. Lawrence's unsettling opinions earned him many enemies and he endured hardships, official persecution, censorship and misrepresentation of his creative work throughout the second half of his life, much of which he spent in a voluntary exile he called his &quot;savage pilgrimage.&quot; He is now generally valued as a visionary thinker and a significant representative of modernism in English literature.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140283372","urn:ISBN:9781857150773","urn:ISBN:9780141441542","urn:ISBN:9780486424583","urn:ISBN:9780140188165","urn:ISBN:9780140014853","urn:ISBN:9781853260070","urn:ISBN:9780140042603","urn:ISBN:9780141183367"],"id":66715,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=PAPaAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15854/?feed=opds","author":"David Herbert Lawrence","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Children's literature, English","Ciencia-ficción","Classic Literature","Fiction","GITenberg","In library","Literature","Mentally ill","Mentally ill -- Fiction","OverDrive","PR","Protected DAISY","Psychological fiction","Science Fiction","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Scientists","Scientists -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-07-27T16:42:02","language":"en","title":"The Invisible Man","issued":"1897-2012","summary":"Title: The Invisible Man.

One of the most influential thinkers of the Western civilization, a man who profoundly shaped the mind-set of the modern world, Immanuel Kant developed his &quot;Categorical Imperative&quot; as a philosophical proof of the &quot;Golden Rule,&quot; and in this 1873 essay, he elaborates upon and defends his understanding of the logical underpinnings of all human morality. Essential reading for anyone seeking an appreciation of modern philosophy, this is an intriguing and provocative work exploring the intersection of morality and reason. German metaphysician IMMANUEL KANT (1724-1804) served as a librarian of the Royal Library, a prestigious government position, and as a professor at Knigsberg University.

A masterpiece of philosophical writing. The theoretical use of reason was concerned with objects of the cognitive faculty only, and a critical examination of it with reference to this use applied properly only to the pure faculty of cognition; because this raised the suspicion, which was afterwards confirmed, that it might easily pass beyond its limits, and be lost among unattainable objects, or even contradictory notions. It is quite different with the practical use of reason. In this, reason is concerned with the grounds of determination of the will, which is a faculty either to produce objects corresponding to ideas, or to determine ourselves to the effecting of such objects; that is, to determine our causality. -Immanuel Kant","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780486434452","urn:ISBN:9780521599627","urn:ISBN:9780023077531","urn:ISBN:9781573920636","urn:ISBN:9780872206175","urn:ISBN:9780672602238","urn:ISBN:9780872206182","urn:ISBN:9780023077609","urn:ISBN:9781452801261"],"id":66900,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=4n5v9sIcWbwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/21951/?feed=opds","author":"Immanuel Kant","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","Literature","Nonfiction"],"updated":"2012-05-25T17:18:08","language":"en","title":"The Cunning Little Vixen","issued":"1986","summary":"","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780374133474"],"id":74265,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=9jMnHQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/800/?feed=opds","author":"Rudolf Tesnohlidek","isOwn":false},{"category":["Computers","Nonfiction","Software"],"updated":"2014-03-11T10:00:24","language":"en","title":"Producing Open Source Software","issued":"2005","summary":"The corporate market is now embracing free, &quot;open source&quot; software like never before, as evidenced by the recent success of the technologies underlying LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). Each is the result of a publicly collaborative process among numerous developers who volunteer their time and energy to create better software.\r\n<br />\r\nThe truth is, however, that the overwhelming majority of free software projects fail. To help you beat the odds, O'Reilly has put together Producing Open Source Software, a guide that recommends tried and true steps to help free software developers work together toward a common goal. Not just for developers who are considering starting their own free software project, this book will also help those who want to participate in the process at any level.\r\n<br />\r\nThe book tackles this very complex topic by distilling it down into easily understandable parts. Starting with the basics of project management, it details specific tools used in free software projects, including version control, IRC, bug tracking, and Wikis. Author Karl Fogel, known for his work on CVS and Subversion, offers practical advice on how to set up and use a range of tools in combination with open mailing lists and archives. He also provides several chapters on the essentials of recruiting and motivating developers, as well as how to gain much-needed publicity for your project.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhile managing a team of enthusiastic developers -- most of whom you've never even met -- can be challenging, it can also be fun.

She began it soon after she had finishedEmma and completed it in August 1816. She died, aged 41, in 1817; Persuasion was published in December of that year (but dated 1818).<br /><br />\r\nPersuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly inBath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from 1801 to 1805.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBesides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics, such as the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen's brothers ultimately rose to the rank of admiral. As in Northanger Abbey, the superficial social life of Bath—well known to Austen, who spent several relatively unhappy and unproductive years there—is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of the book. In many respects, Persuasion marks a break with Austen's previous works, both in the more biting, even irritable satire directed at some of the novel's characters and in the regretful, resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine, Anne Elliot, in the first part of the story. Against this is set the energy and appeal of the Royal Navy, which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of a more outgoing, engaged, and fulfilling life, and it is this worldview which triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780760750872","urn:ISBN:9789510214411","urn:ISBN:9783379200547","urn:ISBN:9780307290830","urn:ISBN:9789639752405","urn:ISBN:9788374698108","urn:ISBN:9783442743001","urn:ISBN:9780141439686","urn:ISBN:9781440468391"],"id":128744,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=6aHvygAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1145/?feed=opds","author":"Jane Austen","isOwn":false},{"category":[" Biography","Nonfiction"],"updated":"2014-08-05T12:27:51","language":"en","title":"What Do We Know About the World?

The dialogues suggest that Percy Shelley was right when he claimed “We are all Greeks,” and yet what have we learned about the initiatives of culture and literature since our classical predecessors? Begam and Soderholm’s ten dialogues function as a series of dual-meditations that take Plato as an intellectual godfather while presenting a new form of dialogic knowledge based on the friction and frisson of two minds contending, inventing and improvising. The authors discuss not only what is healthy and vigorous about Western culture but also consider where that culture is in retreat, as they seek to understand the legacy of the Enlightenment and its relation to the contemporary moment. Platonic Occasions is an experiment in criticism that enjoins the reader to imagine what the dialogic imagination can do when inspired by Platonic inquiry, but not bound by a single master and the singular mind. Beyond Socratic maieutics and Cartesian meditation is a form of intellectual interplay where it is impossible not to be of two minds.\r\n<br /><br />Buy hardcopy at <a href=\"http://www.stockholmuniversitypress.se/site/books/detail/1/platonic-occasions/\">Stockholm University Press</a>.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9789176350003","urn:ISBN:9789176350027","urn:ISBN:9789176350034","urn:ISBN:9789176350010"],"id":142457,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/1d/b9/1db95a5c91b9243ec9fa72175f43c416.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2660/?feed=opds","author":"Richard Begam","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adult fiction","Canadian Science fiction","Erotic fiction","Fiction","Novella"],"updated":"2015-09-26T23:37:55","language":"en","title":"Take Me (Anticore Part One)","issued":"2015","summary":"Garrick feels a rising tide of lust the moment step-sibling hacktivists Ryann and Jaxson stride into his life.

S. Bach was a natural language; he wrote fugues in organ toccatas and voluntaries, in masses and motets, in orchestral and chamber music, and even in his sonatas for violin solo. The more intimate fugues he wrote for keyboard are among the greatest, most infl uential, and best-loved works in all of Western music. They have long been the foundation of the keyboard repertory, played by beginning students and world-famous virtuosi alike. In a series of elegantly written essays, eminent musicologist Joseph Kerman discusses his favorite Bach keyboard fugues—some of them among the best-known fugues and others much less familiar. Kerman skillfully, at times playfully, reveals the inner workings of these pieces, linking the form of the fugues with their many different characters and expressive qualities, and illuminating what makes them particularly beautiful, powerful, and moving.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBuy print editions at <a href=\"http://www.luminosoa.org/site/books/detail/1/art-of-fugue/\">Luminos OA.</a></p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780520941397","urn:ISBN:9780520243583","urn:ISBN:9780520962590","urn:ISBN:9780520287631"],"id":151746,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/99/d3/99d3817c99e195b7e5100d52d453bc91.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3056/?feed=opds","author":"Joseph Kerman","isOwn":false},{"category":["Healthcare","Mental health","Nonfiction","People with disabilities","Textbooks"],"updated":"2015-10-28T21:26:22","language":"en","title":"Supporting Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities & Mental Illness","issued":"2015","summary":"<p>\r\n\tWhat caregivers need to know when supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities and mental illness.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis multidisciplinary resource develops topics of interest to all those who care about and for individuals with co-occurring intellectual disabilities and mental illness.

Addressing these new realities in America’s metropolitan regions, this book argues that a few lessons are emerging: first, inequity is bad for economic growth; second, bringing together the concerns of equity and growth requires concerted local action; and third, the fundamental building block for doing this is the creation of diverse and dynamic epistemic (or knowledge) communities, which help to overcome political polarization and to address the challenges of economic restructuring and social divides.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“As America bolts toward a more multiracial future in the face of skyrocketing inequality, local leaders are desperately seeking strategies to foster more inclusive growth.

Social, psychological, financial, bodily, emotional: known and unknown costs, often to bystanders, turn any strategy to gain and protect freedom into an ambiguous quest. Sometimes it isn't clear what freedom means. Many people use and produce bits of free knowledge, but any serious attempt quickly runs into tremendous barriers, in every field. Participants receive unequal welcome due to gender, language, cultural or economic differences. Occasionally, the production of intangible assets may intersect with broader historical movements, redefining their meanings and exposing their participants to unlimited costs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tConsidering the costs borne by millions to obtain, for example, freedom from slavery or freedom to vote, free knowledge movements seem rather safe and straightforward. By contrast, to consider the costs of free culture, free software or open scientific research may look adventurous, or perhaps just presumptuous. But this is what we will attempt to do, with appropriate humility. This book wants to discuss how free knowledge movements are built and the real costs attached to them. Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers, and writers involved with free knowledge movements have worked together to see further than the fog of our news feeds and produce some sense from our different experiences.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis book is born in an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil Sadafi, loved and celebrated Internet volunteer detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.

Each chapter contains a clear introduction to the field, cases and secondary readings illustrating the structure and conflicts in the theory and doctrine of intellectual property, followed by questions to test the student's understanding. Every chapter is built around a set of problems or role-playing exercises involving the material. The problems range from a video of the Napster oral argument, with the students asked to take the place of the lawyers, to exercises counseling clients about how search engines and trademarks interact, to discussions of the First Amendment's application to Digital Rights Management or the Supreme Court’s new rulings on gene patents.

How do we live with the moral dissonance between what we are tempted to do and what is in line with our moral convictions? What can organizations do to establish a foundation for responsible decision-making and conduct? This book combines research streams from ethics and moral psychology using extensive experience of sessions of moral reasoning with leaders and employees in organizations. It argues that there is a need to go beyond compliance and traditional approaches to ethics in order to prepare decision-makers for moral dilemmas.

The posts centred around the general theme of how we manage shared assets and what alternative approaches there might be, informed by research and practice in the governance of commons resources. The whole area of commons and management of common pool resources has become more topical over the last 6 years following the award of the Nobel Prize for Economics to Elinor Ostrom, for her work on commons. Commons has long been an element of research within CCRI, particularly in relation to Common Land and Town and village Greens in England and Wales. Chris Short organised annual conferences on common land management from 1999-2010 which attracted over 1,500 delegates and sponsorship from the Countryside Agency, Defra, Natural England and the Countryside Council for Wales. This book is no more than a set of ‘musings’ or collected thoughts about a range of issues which we have addressed in our professional activities. It does not claim to address all aspects of an issue, or to present a balanced view of research findings. The aim is simply to present some of our ideas about management and governance of a range of resources that can be perceived in some way as ‘shared assets’. The resources addressed range from the local to the global, and encompass what have been termed traditional commons (such as fisheries, pasture, water) and ‘new’ commons such as the internet and urban areas. Our purpose in producing this book is to raise awareness of the principles of commons governance. Our aim is to encourage thinking about the ways in which application of these principles might open up alternative solutions to achieving long-term and sustainable management of the many assets that we share in common.  </p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781861742186"],"id":157201,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/20/06/20069b88e03700ffaffb005752ca7345.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3396/?feed=opds","author":"John Powell","isOwn":false},{"category":{"term":"18-","scheme":"http://schema.org/typicalAgeRange","label":"Adult/Advanced Reader"},"updated":"2016-04-06T21:15:56","language":"en","title":"Instruments for New Music: Sound, Technology, and Modernism","issued":"2013-2015","summary":"<p>Player pianos, radio-electric circuits, gramophone records, and optical sound film—these were the cutting-edge acoustic technologies of the early twentieth century, and for many musicians and artists of the time, these devices were also the implements of a musical revolution. <em>Instruments for New Music</em> traces a diffuse network of cultural agents who shared the belief that a truly modern music could be attained only through a radical challenge to the technological foundations of the art. Centered in Germany during the 1920s and 1930s, the movement to create new instruments encompassed a broad spectrum of experiments, from the exploration of microtonal tunings and exotic tone colors to the ability to compose directly for automatic musical machines. This movement comprised composers, inventors, and visual artists, including Paul Hindemith, Ernst Toch, Jörg Mager, Friedrich Trautwein, László Moholy-Nagy, Walter Ruttmann, and Oskar Fischinger. Patteson’s fascinating study combines an artifact-oriented history of new music in the early twentieth century with an astute revisiting of still-relevant debates about the relationship between technology and the arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Print edition available from <a href=\"http://www.luminosoa.org/site/books/detail/7/instruments-for-new-music/\">University of California Press</a>.</p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780520288027","urn:ISBN:9780520963122"],"id":157987,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/24/06/240639edb30509ccbbda6d783f3623a5.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3609/?feed=opds","author":"Thomas Patteson","isOwn":false},{"category":{"term":"7-8","scheme":"http://schema.org/typicalAgeRange","label":"Children's - Grade 2-3, Age 7-8"},"updated":"2016-05-07T12:30:42","language":"en","title":"Sugar the Robot and the race to save the Earth","issued":"2013","summary":"<p>Tim is ten years old and mad about robots.

The first is through visual adaptations of the key content in the book. It is well documented that many of today’s students are visual learners. To meet students’ wants and needs (and thereby create a much better teaching experience for professors), Mastering Strategic Management contains multiple graphic concept pages in ever section of every chapter of the book. Think of graphic concept pages as almost like info-graphics for key concepts in each section. This feature sets Mastering Strategic Management apart from any strategic management book on the market today. The second way the authors capture student interest through their textbook is by using a real-world company as the running example in each chapter. For example, Chapter 1 in Mastering Strategic Management utilizes Blackberry to harness the conceptual coverage of the chapter in a running, corporate, application to which students will relate. The third inventive way Mastering Strategic Management holds the attention of strategic management students is through the “strategy at the movies” feature in each chapter that links course concepts with a popular motion picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Print edition available from <a href=\"http://open.bccampus.ca/find-open-textbooks/?uuid=807b5297-67ba-4e65-8dc7-c871e6c633ac\">BCcampus OpenEd</a></p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781453369500","urn:ISBN:9781453369517","urn:ISBN:9781453323106","urn:ISBN:9781453332382","urn:ISBN:9781413306132","urn:ISBN:9781429302067","urn:ISBN:9781429302074"],"id":194301,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/18548/?feed=opds","author":"Janice Edwards","isOwn":false},{"category":["Juvenile Fiction","Juvenile Fiction / Fantasy & Magic"],"updated":"2016-11-24T21:52:54","language":"en","title":"The Cave Escape","issued":"2015","summary":"<p>Peter scraped the thick layer of dust from the large wooden chest with his fingers, and lifted the rusty clasp.

He was born at Salem, Mass., on July 4th, 1804, son of a sea-captain. He led there a shy and rather somber life; of few artistic encouragements, yet not wholly uncongenial, his moody, intensely meditative temperament being considered. Its colors and shadows are marvelously reflected in his _Twice-Told Tales_ and other short stories, the product of his first literary period. Even his college days at Bowdoin did not quite break through his acquired and inherited reserve; but beneath it all, his faculty of divining men and women was exercised with almost uncanny prescience and subtlety. _The Scarlet Letter, _ which explains as much of this unique imaginative art, as is to be gathered from reading his highest single achievement, yet needs to be ranged with his other writings, early and late, to have its last effect. In the year that saw it published, he began _The House of the Seven Gables, _ a later romance or prose-tragedy of the Puritan-American community as he had himself known it -- defrauded of art and the joy of life, &quot;starving for symbols&quot; as Emerson has it. Nathaniel Hawthorne died at Plymouth, New Hampshire, on May 18th, 1864.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781426445545","urn:ISBN:9780553210095","urn:ISBN:9780142437261","urn:ISBN:9780743487566","urn:ISBN:9780679783381","urn:ISBN:9781442140714","urn:ISBN:9781936594276","urn:ISBN:9781593082079","urn:ISBN:9780486280486"],"id":62522,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=hS9rmX2zmwAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4756/?feed=opds","author":"Nathaniel Hawthorne","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Anglo-Saxons","Anglo-Saxons -- Fiction","Children's literature, English","Chivalry","Classic Literature","Crusades","English literature","Fiction","French literature","German language","GITenberg","Great Britain -- History -- Richard I, 1189-1199 -- Fiction","Historical fiction","History","In library","Ivanhoe, Wilfred of, Sir (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","Jews","Jews -- England -- Fiction","Juvenile Fiction","Knights and knighthood","Knights and knighthood -- Fiction","Literature","Love stories","Medieval Civilization","Normans","Normans -- Great Britain -- Fiction","OverDrive","PR","Protected DAISY","Readers","Sir Ivanhoe, Wilfred of (Fictitious character)","Translations from English","Translations into French","Triangles (Interpersonal relations)","Triangles (Interpersonal relations) -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-05T22:04:47","language":"en","title":"Ivanhoe","issued":"1906-2011","summary":"Ivanhoe (1819) by Sir Walter Scott is the quintessential novel of romantic medieval chivalry, beloved by generations of readers.

She saw no Indians now she saw flour mills and the blinking windows ofskyscrapers in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Nor was she thinking of squaws and portages and the Yankee fur-traders whose shadows were all about her. She was meditating upon walnut fudge, the plays of Brieux f the reasons why keels run over, and the fact that the chemistry instructor ad stared at the new coiffure which concealed her ears. A breeze which had crossed a thousand miles of wheat-lands bellied her taffeta skirt in a line so graceful, so full of animation and moving beauty, that the heart of a chance watcher on the lower road tightened to wistfulness over her quality of sus pended freedom. She lifted her arms, she leaned back against the wind, her skirt dipped and flared, a lock blew wild. A girl on a hilltop credulous, plastic, young drinking the air as she longed to drink life. The eternal aching comedy of expectant youth. It is Carol Milford, fleeing for an hour from Blodgett College.

But it secretes friendly girls, young men who sing, and one lady instructress who really likes Milton and Carlyle. So the four years which Carol spent at Biodgett were not altogether wasted. The smallness of the school, the fewness of rivals, permitted her to experiment with her perilous versatility. She played tennis, gave chafing-dish parties, took a graduate seminar in the drama, went twosing, and joined half a dozen societies for the practise of the arts or the tense stalking of a thing called General Culture.

Barnes &amp; Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Acclaimed as one of the greatest works of nonfiction published in the twentieth century, William James’s The Varieties of Religious Experience was revolutionary in its view of religious life as centered not within the Church but solely within “the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude.” Using the language of psychology, James tries to explain religious phenomena—such as conversion, repentance, mysticism, and saintliness—as psychic energy that arises from the unconscious mind in times of trouble. To support his theories, James turns to the autobiographical writings of a wide variety of mystics and writers, including Walt Whitman, Martin Luther, Voltaire, Emerson, and Tolstoy. The result is a colorful and wide-ranging collection of recorded experiences that James compares, categorizes, and analyzes. Many of his categories—including the sick soul, the divided self, and healthy-mindedness—have become standard in the study of religions. Exquisitely written, The Varieties of Religious Experience has had a profound influence on modern spiritual thought, including the psychology of religion and recovery programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Wayne Proudfoot is Professor of Religion at Columbia University, specializing in the philosophy of religion. He has published Religious Experience, as well as articles on William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, and American Protestant thought.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780006425205","urn:ISBN:9780140390346","urn:ISBN:9780679640110","urn:ISBN:9781593080723","urn:ISBN:9780684842974","urn:ISBN:9781426442896","urn:ISBN:9780679600756","urn:ISBN:9781402199035","urn:ISBN:9780980060546"],"id":64808,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=kT1WcAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6113/?feed=opds","author":"William James","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Amulets","Brothers and sisters","Brothers and sisters -- Fiction","Children's literature, English","Children's stories, English","England","Fairies","Fairies -- Fiction","Fairy tales","Fantasy","Fantasy fiction","Fiction","Great Britain -- History -- Edward VII, 1901-1910 -- Fiction","History","In library","Juvenile Fiction","PR","Protected DAISY","PZ","Stories","Wishes","Wishes -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T20:11:28","language":"en","title":"Five children and it","issued":"1941-2011","summary":"Like Nesbit's Railway Children, the story begins when a group of children move from London to the countryside of Kent. While playing in a gravel pit soon after the move, they uncover a rather grumpy, ugly and occasionally malevolent sand-fairy known as the Psammead who is compelled to grant one wish of theirs per day. Edith Nesbit (1858-1924) was a prolific children's author, publishing more than forty novels or collections of stories. Collaborating with others, Nesbit published about as many more. Her children's books are known for being entertaining without turning didactic, although some of her earlier works, notably Five Children and It veered in this direction. According to her biographer Julia Briggs, Nesbit was &quot;the first modern writer for children&quot; and &quot;helped to reverse the great tradition of children's literature inaugurated by Carroll, MacDonald and Kenneth Grahame, in turning away from their secondary worlds to the tough truths to be won from encounters with things-as-they-are, previously the province of adult novels.&quot; Briggs also credits Nesbit with inventing the children's adventure story. Among Nesbit's best-known books are The Story of the Treasure Seekers (1898) and The Wouldbegoods (1899), which both recount stories about the Bastables, a fictional family that Nesbit likely styled upon her own childhood family. Nesbit's children's writing also included numerous plays and collections of verse.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140301281","urn:ISBN:9780140367355","urn:ISBN:9780141321615","urn:ISBN:9780590421461","urn:ISBN:9780143039150","urn:ISBN:9780140350616","urn:ISBN:9781853261244","urn:ISBN:9781592249381","urn:ISBN:9780688135454"],"id":65223,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=mD5X3THHTmQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6509/?feed=opds","author":"Edith Nesbit","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Advertising","Advertising -- Fiction","American Manuscripts","Bildungsromans","Children of the rich","Children of the rich -- Fiction","Classic Literature","College stories","College students","College students -- Fiction","Facsimiles","Fiction","Fiction in English","GITenberg","In library","Literature","Love stories","Manuscripts","OverDrive","Protected DAISY","PS","Romance","Veterans","World War, 1914-1918","World War, 1914-1918 -- Veterans -- Fiction","Young Adult Fiction","Young men","Young men -- Fiction"],"publishers":[{"publisher":"Recovering the Classics"}],"updated":"2016-07-27T16:57:50","language":"en","title":"This Side of Paradise","issued":"1920-2012","summary":"First published in 1920, This Side of Paradise marks the beginning of the career of one of the greatest writers of the first half of the twentieth century. In this remarkable achievement, F. Scott Fitzgerald displays his unparalleled wit and keen social insight in his portrayal of college life through the struggles and doubts of Amory Blaine, a self-proclaimed genius with a love of knowledge and a penchant for the romantic. As Amory journeys into adulthood and leaves the aristocratic egotism of his youth behind, he becomes painfully aware of his lost innocence and the new sense of responsibility and regret that has taken its place. Clever and wonderfully written, This Side of Paradise is a fascinating novel about the changes of the Jazz Age and their effects on the individual. It is a complex portrait of a versatile mind in a restless generation that reveals rich ideas crucial to an understanding of the 1920s and timeless truths about the human need for--and fear of--change. &quot;A very enlivening book indeed, a book really brilliant and glamorous, making as agreeable reading as could be asked . . . There are clever things, keen and searching things, amusingly young and mistaken things, beautiful things and pretty things . . . and truly inspired and elevated things, an astonishing abundance of each, in THIS SIDE OF PARADISE. You could call it the youthful Byronism that is normal in a man of the author's type, working out through a well-furnished intellect of unusual critical force.&quot; --The Evening Post, 1920 &quot;An astonishing and refreshing book . . . Mr. Fitzgerald has recorded with a good deal of felicity and a disarming frankness the adventures and developments of a curious and fortunate American youth. . . . [It is] delightful and encouraging to find a novel which gives us in the accurate terms of intellectual honesty a reflection of American undergraduate life. At last the revelation has come. We have the constant young American occupation--the 'petting party'--frankly and humorously in our literature.&quot; --The New Republic, 1920 From the Paperback edition.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780679447238","urn:ISBN:9780684843780","urn:ISBN:9781595478665","urn:ISBN:9780486289991","urn:ISBN:9780375758867","urn:ISBN:9781439198988","urn:ISBN:9781593083816","urn:ISBN:9781406944730","urn:ISBN:9780671535551"],"id":65231,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=UB6VQFCLjL0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4744/?feed=opds","author":"Francis Scott Fitzgerald","isOwn":false},{"category":["Brothers and sisters","Brothers and sisters -- Juvenile fiction","Brothers and sisters in fiction","Children's literature, English","English Fantasy fiction","Fantasy fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Great Britain -- History -- Edward VII, 1901-1910 -- Juvenile fiction","Great Britain in fiction","History","Juvenile Fiction","Magic","Magic -- Juvenile fiction","Magic in fiction","Mythical Animals","Phoenix (Mythical bird)","Phoenix (Mythical bird) -- Juvenile fiction","PR","Protected DAISY","PZ"],"updated":"2016-08-07T11:07:24","language":"en","title":"The Phoenix and the Carpet","issued":"1956-2011","summary":"Edith Nesbit (1858-1924) was an English author and poet who wrote and collaborated on over 60 books of children's fiction, and is considered today to be one of the founders of modern children's literature.

Mortimer, in spite of all the arts-of the chemist, placidly refreshes himself with a glass of Madeira, and remains unconscious of the document which engrosses the general attention, until Lady 'Pippins (who has a habit of waking totally insensible), having remembered where she is, and recovered a perception of surrounding objects, says: &quot; Falser man than Don Juan; why don't you take the note from the Commendatorc ?&quot; Upon which, the chemist advances it under the nose of Mortimer, who looks round at him, and says: &quot; What's this ? &quot; Analytical Chemist bonds and whispers. &quot; Who f &quot; says Mortimer.

Barnes &amp; Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Set in early twentieth-century London and inspired by an actual attempt to blow up the Greenwich Observatory, The Secret Agent is a complex exploration of motivation and morality. The title character, Adolf Verloc, is obviously no James Bond. In fact, he and his circle of misfit saboteurs are not spies but terrorists, driven less by political ideals than by their unruly emotions and irrational hatreds. Verloc has settled into an apparent marriage of convenience. Family life gives him a respectable cover, while his wife hopes to get help in handling her halfwit brother, Stevie. Instead Verloc involves Stevie in one of his explosive schemes, an act that leads to violence, murder, and revenge. Darkly comic, the novel is also obliquely autobiographical: Joseph Conrad’s parents were involved in the radical politics of their time, and their early deaths left him profoundly distrustful of any sort of political action.

Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes &amp; Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices &amp; Glossaries, when appropriateAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes &amp; Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Immediately recognized as a masterpiece when it was first published in 1847, Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre is an extraordinary coming-of-age story featuring one of the most independent and strong-willed female protagonists in all of literature. Poor and plain, Jane Eyre begins life as a lonely orphan in the household of her hateful aunt. Despite the oppression she endures at home, and the later torture of boarding school, Jane manages to emerge with her spirit and integrity unbroken. She becomes a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she finds herself falling in love with her employer—the dark, impassioned Mr. Rochester. But an explosive secret tears apart their relationship, forcing Jane to face poverty and isolation once again. One of the world’s most beloved novels, Jane Eyre is a startlingly modern blend of passion, romance, mystery, and suspense. Susan Ostrov Weisser is a Professor of English at Adelphi University, where she specializes in nineteenth-century literature and women’s studies. Her research centers on women and romantic love in nineteenth-century literature, as well as on contemporary popular culture. Weisser also wrote the introduction to the Barnes &amp; Noble Classics edition of Persuasion.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781612930657","urn:ISBN:9789510138380","urn:ISBN:9789512326280","urn:ISBN:9789516433977","urn:ISBN:9780717286683","urn:ISBN:9781870418010","urn:ISBN:9789561213432","urn:ISBN:9789510012079","urn:ISBN:9781435203990"],"id":65310,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=_1dBPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4843/?feed=opds","author":"Charlotte Brontë","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Ancient Philosophy","B","Classic Literature","Classical literature","Early works to 1800","Ethics -- Early works to 1800","Fiction","GITenberg","Idea (Philosophy)","In library","Literature","OverDrive","PA","Philosophy","Protected DAISY","Socrates, 470 BC-399 BC","Vertus","Virtue","Virtue -- Early works to 1800"],"updated":"2016-08-09T19:26:27","language":"en","title":"Meno","issued":"1949-2011","summary":"This 1961 edition of Plato's Meno was originally edited by R.

Its value lies in the incredibly extensive preliminary chapters provided by Bluck, designed to truly enhance the reader's engagement with this ancient text. In almost 150 pages of introductory chapters, Bluck reviews the argument of the Meno, its relation to wider philosophical and dialogues (written both before and after Plato), and summarises Plato's use of the hypothetical method in the Meno, the Phaedo and the Republic. He also provides a detailed synopsis of Plato's Meno before presenting the full Greek text, accompanied by a wide-ranging and incredibly accessible commentary. Finally, Bluck presents the reader with indices in both English and Greek, ensuring that this volume remains an endlessly rewarding reference and research work.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781420926873","urn:ISBN:9780941051712","urn:ISBN:9780672601736","urn:ISBN:9780521640336","urn:ISBN:9780521172288","urn:ISBN:9781427009906","urn:ISBN:9780824095734","urn:ISBN:9780856682483","urn:ISBN:9781604507812"],"id":66093,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=cxyS_ovuo_wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8691/?feed=opds","author":"Plato","isOwn":false},{"category":["Children's literature, English","Detective and mystery stories, English","Fiction","GITenberg","Holmes, Sherlock (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","PR","Private investigators -- England -- Fiction"],"publishers":[{"publisher":"Recovering the Classics"}],"updated":"2016-07-27T17:42:26","language":"en","title":"Adventures of Sherlock Holmes","issued":"1892-2012","summary":"","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781853260339","urn:ISBN:9781569602188","urn:ISBN:9780439574280","urn:ISBN:9780895772770","urn:ISBN:9781612930282","urn:ISBN:9780140057249","urn:ISBN:9781566198592","urn:ISBN:9781936594603","urn:ISBN:9780812504248"],"id":99401,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=oqkC3PTplRsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4825/?feed=opds","author":"ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Classic Literature","Classical literature","Classical Mythology","Fiction","French literature","GITenberg","Historical fiction","History and criticism","Humor (Fiction)","In library","Isis (Egyptian deity)","Latin American literature","Latin fiction","Latin literature","Literature","Medieval and modern Latin literature","Metamorphosis","Metamorphosis -- Fiction","Metamorphosis in literature","Mythology, Classical","Mythology, Classical, in literature","OverDrive","PA","Protected DAISY","Translations from Latin","Translations into English","Translations into French","Translations into German","Translations into Italian","Translations into Russian","Translations into Spanish"],"updated":"2016-08-09T19:38:54","language":"en","title":"The golden ass","issued":"1915-2012","summary":"This is an OCR edition with typos.Excerpt from book: INDEX Achaea, province of, 505 Acheron, 551 Act aeon, 55 Actinm, 309 Adlington, life, viii; English style, viii, ix, xviii; marginal notes, examples of, 412, 444, 492, 511, 51!

K. Chesterton expounded prolifically about his wide-ranging philosophies. Chesterton is impossible to categorize as &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; across a wide variety of avenues: he was a literary critic, historian, playwright, novelist, columnist, and poet. His witty, humorous style earned him the title of the &quot;prince of paradox,&quot; and his works-80 books and nearly 4,000 essays-remain among the most beloved in the English language Considered by many readers to be G. K. Chesterton's best work, &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot; is an outrageous satire about a club of gentlemen in London at the turn of the 20th century who have vowed to destroy the world. Subtitled &quot;A Nightmare,&quot; and bursting with Chesterton's trademark wit and abundant in surprising metaphors about religion, nature, and human civilization itself, &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot; is a philosophical and ironic wonder, a delight to read and an even greater delight to ponder. G. K. Chesterton was one of the most influential English writers of the 20th century. His prolific and diverse output included journalism, philosophy, poetry, biography, Christian apologetics, fantasy and detective fiction. Chesterton has been called the &quot;prince of paradox&quot;. Time magazine, in a review of a biography of Chesterton, observed of his writing style: &quot;Whenever possible Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegories-first carefully turning them inside out.&quot;For example, Chesterton wrote the following: Thieves respect property. They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it. Chesterton is well known for his reasoned apologetics and even those who disagree with him have recognized the universal appeal of such works as Orthodoxy and &quot;The Everlasting Man,&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday.&quot;","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780375757914","urn:ISBN:9781595970015","urn:ISBN:9780140183887","urn:ISBN:9781853262364","urn:ISBN:9780486251219","urn:ISBN:9780141031255","urn:ISBN:9780140000955","urn:ISBN:9781420925142","urn:ISBN:9780141033754"],"id":66099,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=cL812LvVMpcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8838/?feed=opds","author":"Gilbert Keith Chesterton","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","B","Classical literature","Early works to 1800","Early works to 1850","GITenberg","In library","Literature","Mind and body","PA","Philosophy","Pleasure","Pleasure -- Early works to 1800","Protected DAISY"],"updated":"2016-08-09T20:21:45","language":"en","title":"Philebus","issued":"1975-2009","summary":"With The Tragedy and Comedy of Life, Seth Benardete completes his examination of Plato's understanding of the beautiful, the just, and the good. Benardete first treated the beautiful in The Being of the Beautiful (1984), which dealt with the Theaetetus, Sophist, and Statesman; and he treated the just in Socrates Second Sailing (1989), which dealt with the Republic and sought to determine the just in its relation to the beautiful and the good. Benardete focuses in this volume on the good as discussed in the Philebus, which is widely regarded as one of Plato's most complex dialogues. Traditionally, the Philebus is interpreted as affirming the supposedly Platonic doctrine that the good resides in thought and mind rather than in pleasure or the body. Benardete challenges this view, arguing that Socrates vindicates the life of the mind over against the life of pleasure not by separating the two and advocating a strict asceticism, but by mixing pleasure and pain with mind in such a way that the philosophic life emerges as the only possible human life. Socrates accomplishes this by making use of two principles - the limited and the unlimited - and shows that the very possibility of philosophy requires not just the limited but also the unlimited, for the unlimited permeates the entirety of life as well as the endless perplexity of thinking itself. Benardete combines a probing and challenging commentary that subtly mirrors and illumines the complexities of this extraordinarily difficult dialogue with the finest English translation of the Philebus yet available. The result is a work that will be of great value to classicists, philosophers, and political theorists alike.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781404325678","urn:ISBN:9780872201705","urn:ISBN:9780226042398","urn:ISBN:9780872201712","urn:ISBN:9780226042763","urn:ISBN:9780140448672","urn:ISBN:9780198720447"],"id":66104,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=XnRkPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8946/?feed=opds","author":"Plato","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Constitutional law","Constitutional law.","Early works to 1700","Early works to 1800","GITenberg","History","In library","JC","Literature","PA","Political Science","Political science -- Early works to 1800","Protected DAISY","Religion and politics","Social conditions","State, The -- Early works to 1800","Statutes","The State","Utopias"],"updated":"2016-08-09T20:25:39","language":"en","title":"Laws","issued":"1970-2011","summary":"A sharp contrast to the Utopian nature of The Republic, Laws sets out in practical form the structure of actual society, and how, realistically, humanity can expect to govern itself.

It is more often than not the closest we can now get to what Shakespeare actually wrote. But the folio's antiquated typography and cramped layout make it remote and inaccessible to modern eyes. The Shakespeare Folios on the other hand offer easy access directly to the First Folio by presenting the text in modern type but otherwise unchanged. All the First Folio's idiosyncrasies of layout and spelling, even its obvious errors, have been scrupulously left intact, but the text suddenly becomes as easily legible as the script of any modern play. Now readers can see for themselves what the Folio actually says: whether and where there are stage directions; where the punctuation falls; and exactly how the speeches are set out line by line. And they can make up their own minds about the problematic words and phrases that have puzzled generations of Shakespeare scholars. As an additional aid to understanding, readers will find, printed opposite each page of the Folio, the very same passage in a modern edition. So, whenever the Folio presents a problem, the reader can refer to this parallel text for a solution, either in the text itself or in the set of notes at the end of the book. These notes draw on the long tradition of Shakespearean scholarship and include full reference to surviving Quarto texts. Using these two versions of the play in parallel - one thoroughly authentic, the other carefully modernized - readers, be they students or scholars, actors or directors, theatregoers or Shakespeare specialists, can achieve an unprecedented understanding of one of the most significant works in the history of English literature.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140714586","urn:ISBN:9780743484879","urn:ISBN:9780451526908","urn:ISBN:9780140707083","urn:ISBN:9780671722654","urn:ISBN:9780451522863","urn:ISBN:9780553212952","urn:ISBN:9780192834232","urn:ISBN:9781853260889"],"id":201085,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=jVs_AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10333/?feed=opds","author":"William Shakespeare","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adultery -- Fiction","Aristocracy (Social class) -- Fiction","Fiction","German fiction -- 19th century","Love stories, German","PT","Social problems -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-24T15:36:43","language":"de","title":"Die Wahlverwandtschaften","issued":"1915-2008","summary":"Baron Eduard hat seine Jugendliebe Charlotte geheiratet und kann sich nun der gärtnerisch-architektonischen Umgestaltung seines Landguts widmen.

It was Goethe's first major success, turning him from an unknown into a celebrated author practically overnight. --- The majority of the novel is presented as a collection of letters written by Werther, a young artist of a highly sensitive and passionate temperament, and sent to his friend Wilhelm. In these letters, Werther gives a very intimate account of his stay in the fictional village of Wahlheim (based on the town of Garbenheim, near Wetzlar), where he meets and falls in love with Lotte, a beautiful young girl who is taking care of her siblings following the death of their mother. Lotte is, however, already engaged to a man named Albert. Despite the pain this causes Werther, he spends the next few months cultivating a close friendship with both of them. Every day serves as a torturing reminder that Lotte will never be able to requite his love...*","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140445039","urn:ISBN:9780679643081","urn:ISBN:9780812969900","urn:ISBN:9780679729518","urn:ISBN:9780394719580","urn:ISBN:9781599867670","urn:ISBN:9780486424552","urn:ISBN:9781934648964","urn:ISBN:9780141023441"],"id":66591,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=F-xrdbnQ6HQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11067/?feed=opds","author":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Adultery","Adultery -- Fiction","Bad Nauheim (Germany) -- Fiction","British","British -- Germany -- Fiction","Classic Literature","Domestic fiction","Fiction","Friendship","Friendship -- Fiction","GITenberg","Hessen (Hesse, Germany : Province) -- Fiction","Literature","Married people","Married people -- Fiction","Middle class","Middle class -- Fiction","OverDrive","PR","Protected DAISY"],"publishers":[{"publisher":"Recovering the Classics"}],"updated":"2016-07-27T14:37:09","language":"en","title":"The Good Soldier","issued":"1946-2012","summary":"&quot;A Tale of Passion,&quot; as its subtitle declares, The Good Soldier relates the complex social and sexual relationships between two couples, one English, one American, and the growing awareness by the American narrator John Dowell of the intrigues and passions behind their orderly Edwardian facade. It is the attitude of Dowell, his puzzlement, uncertainty, and the seemingly haphazard manner of his narration that make the book so powerful and mysterious. Despite its catalogue of death, insanity, and despair, the novel has many comic moments, and has inspired the work of several distinguished writers, including Graham Greene.

His naive Westerner is a blustering pretender to sophistication, a too-quick convert to culture. Turning the coin, the ruins of antiquity appear but a shadow of their heralded glory; the scenery of Europe and the Holy Land dwarfs in contrast to the splendor of a Western landscape. With stunning agility Twain unconsciously uses his travelogue - as Leslie A.

It is set in turn-of-the-century New England in the fictitious town of Starkfield, Massachusetts, and adapted into a film (which starred Liam Neeson) in 1993. Edith Wharton set &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; in a fictional, wintry New England town named Starkfield. There an unnamed narrator tells the story of his encounter with Ethan Frome, a man with dreams and desires that end in an ironic turn of events. The narrator tells the story based on an account from observations at Ethan Frome's house when he had to stay there during a winter storm. Ethan's character is one that comes full circle, moving from silent desire to action to quiet submission, ordered by life's circumstances. &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; is all the more remarkable for its forbidden impressions of rural working-class in New England, especially given that its author was a woman of leisure. The name of the small Massachusetts town represents a bleak, cold and dismal environment. Lenox is also where Edith Wharton had traveled extensively and had come into contact with one of the victims of the accident. Ethan and Mattie cannot escape their dreary life in Starkfield. The connection between the land and the people is a recurring theme of the novel. The narrator is amazed by the harshness of the Starkfield winters and through his experience of the winter he comes to understand the character of the people. In her introduction to the novel, Edith Wharton talks of the &quot;outcropping granite&quot; of New England, the powerful severity of its land and people. This connection between land and people is very much a part of naturalism; the environment is a powerful shaper of man's fate, and the novel represents this relationship by constantly describing the power and cruelty of Starkfield's winter.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780684174877","urn:ISBN:9780451527660","urn:ISBN:9780486266909","urn:ISBN:9780020264804","urn:ISBN:9781840224085","urn:ISBN:9780451522276","urn:ISBN:9780684825915","urn:ISBN:9780140187366","urn:ISBN:9780684719276"],"id":5561,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=bQ23bAe8BTUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4444/?feed=opds","author":"Edith Wharton","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Actresses","Chicago (Ill.) -- Fiction","City and town life","Classic Literature","Didactic fiction","Employment","Fiction","GITenberg","In library","Mistresses","Mistresses -- Fiction","New York (N.Y.) -- Fiction","OverDrive","Protected DAISY","PS","Women","Young women","Young women -- Fiction","Young women in literature"],"updated":"2016-11-10T13:28:10","language":"en","title":"Sister Carrie","issued":"1959-2010","summary":"When a girl leaves her home at eighteen, she does one of two things.

Polidori was one of the earliest pupils at recently established Ampleforth College from 1804, and in 1810 went up to the University of Edinburgh, where he wrote a thesis on sleepwalking and received his degree as a doctor of medicine in 1815 at the age of 19. In 1816 Dr. Polidori entered Lord Byron's service as his personal physician, and accompanied Byron on a trip through Europe. Polidori used a fragment of a story written and quickly abandoned by Byron as the basis for his own tale, The Vampyre, the first vampire story published in English. It was published in 1819 issue of New Monthly Magazine without his permission. Much to both his and Byron's chagrin, The Vampyre was released as a new work by Byron. Byron even released his own Fragment of a Novel in an attempt to clear up the mess, but, for better or worse, The Vampyre continued to be attributed to him. His long, Byron-influenced theological poem The Fall of the Angels, was published anonymously in 1821.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780852632444","urn:ISBN:9781592248797","urn:ISBN:9781461047902","urn:ISBN:9781605065694","urn:ISBN:9780394838441","urn:ISBN:9781438510163","urn:ISBN:9781444693263","urn:ISBN:9781177655217","urn:ISBN:9781141206636"],"id":66917,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=5vRxQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23151/?feed=opds","author":"John William Polidori","isOwn":false},{"category":["Austrian fiction","Fiction","German fiction","German language books","GITenberg","In library","Protected DAISY","PT","Social conditions","Social problems -- Fiction","Translations into English","Trials"],"updated":"2016-07-27T14:01:02","language":"en","title":"The trial","issued":"1937-2011","summary":"A passage from the book... Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K., he knew he had done nothing wrong but, one morning, he was arrested. Every day at eight in the morning he was brought his breakfast by Mrs. Grubach's cook - Mrs. Grubach was his landlady - but today she didn't come. That had never happened before. K. waited a little while, looked from his pillow at the old woman who lived opposite and who was watching him with an inquisitiveness quite unusual for her, and finally, both hungry and disconcerted, rang the bell. There was immediately a knock at the door and a man entered. He had never seen the man in this house before. He was slim but firmly built, his clothes were black and close-fitting, with many folds and pockets, buckles and buttons and a belt, all of which gave the impression of being very practical but without making it very clear what they were actually for. &quot;Who are you?&quot; asked K., sitting half upright in his bed. The man, however, ignored the question as if his arrival simply had to be accepted, and merely replied, &quot;You rang?&quot; &quot;Anna should have brought me my breakfast,&quot; said K. He tried to work out who the man actually was, first in silence, just through observation and by thinking about it, but the man didn't stay still to be looked at for very long. Instead he went over to the door, opened it slightly, and said to someone who was clearly standing immediately behind it, &quot;He wants Anna to bring him his breakfast.&quot;","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781612931036","urn:ISBN:9789146138013","urn:ISBN:9789511184027","urn:ISBN:9789510134887","urn:ISBN:9789171605146","urn:ISBN:9789510127773","urn:ISBN:9789511162995","urn:ISBN:9788205180215","urn:ISBN:9789146144311"],"id":67025,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=-qbotwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4525/?feed=opds","author":"Franz Kafka","isOwn":false},{"category":["Brothers -- Fiction","Didactic fiction","Fathers and sons -- Fiction","GITenberg","PG","Russia -- Social life and customs -- 1533-1917 -- Fiction","Social conditions"],"publishers":[{"publisher":"De Gruyter"},{"publisher":"Recovering the Classics"}],"updated":"2016-07-27T17:42:39","language":"en","title":"Bracia Karamazow","issued":"1912-2011","summary":"","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780553212167","urn:ISBN:9780374528379","urn:ISBN:9780140449242","urn:ISBN:9781593080457","urn:ISBN:9780679729259","urn:ISBN:9780679410034","urn:ISBN:9780486437910","urn:ISBN:9780140445275","urn:ISBN:9780679601814"],"id":99464,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=BZvXZ1au0VcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4828/?feed=opds","author":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","isOwn":false},{"category":["History","Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945)","Nonfiction","Social conditions"],"updated":"2013-12-25T14:14:25","language":"en","title":"Shattered Crystals","issued":"1997","summary":"My name is Eve Rosenzweig Kugler, nee Kanner. I am a child survivor of the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nThis Web Site is the outgrowth of a book I wrote with my mother, Mia Amalia Kanner, titled Shattered Crystals, published in 1997 by CIS Publishers, Lakewood, New Jersey, as part of its Holocaust Diaries series.\r\n\r\nSince the book's publication, important questions about the effects of our Holocaust experience have been raised by readers and at book readings and talks I have been privileged to give. On this Web site I want to try to answer questions and to explore the effect of the Holocaust on child survivors at the time and in adulthood, based on my life as a child survivor and the experiences of child survivors, including individuals I first met in France between 1940 and 1941, and others whom I met subsequently.\r\n\r\nShattered Crystals recounts the history of the escape of my mother, Mia, my father, Sal, and my two sisters Ruth and Lea, from Nazi Germany after Crystal Night in November 1938 and how we defied the odds and survived in France before and after German occupation until liberation. During this period, husband and wife were forced apart, children were separated from parents and sisters from each other. For some of this time, my sisters and I were sheltered, along with other homeless Jewish children, by the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants [OSE], who became vital to the family's survival.\r\n\r\nSome significant matters could not be covered in the book, because they did not lend themselves to the first person format required by the publisher. Foremost in this category is the question of how I and other children coped during the Holocaust and afterwards. In dealing with this issue, I have been able to draw on the experiences of OSE children who settled in America and who have shared their attitudes, feelings and fears. As the OSE is largely unknown except to those whom it benefited, I provide some details of the history of the organization that was so important to our survival.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781560623175"],"id":128675,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=5PDtNAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1028/?feed=opds","author":"Mia Amalia Kanner","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","Science Fiction"],"updated":"2013-12-25T14:33:29","language":"en","title":"Blindsight","issued":"2006-2008","summary":"An odd assortment of diplomats--including a linguist with a multiple personality disorder, a biologist spliced to machinery, a pacifist warrior, and a vampire--journeys to the far edges of the solar system to seek out a mysterious alien presence that may or may not want to meet with them and that may or may not be friendly toward Earth.

Iceland in 2008 experienced an unprecedented economic meltdown that struck fear in the hearts of people all over the world. If it could happen here, it could happen anywhere.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe economic crisis led to a political crisis, with resignations galore. The whining and wailing about the disaster continues to this day, with most commentators blaming deregulation and the free market.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn Deep Freeze, economists Philipp Bagus and David Howden demonstrate that the real cause of the calamity was bad central bank policy. Rates were way too low, banks were too big to fail, housing was implicitly guaranteed, and banks were borrowing short term from abroad to finance long term bonds.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe authors discuss the implications of this maturity mismatching and zero in on the central bank policies that encouraged unsound practices. They demonstrate the cause and effect without a shadow of a doubt, using vast amounts of data and a detailed sector-by-sector look at the economy of Iceland.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhat they find is another instance of the Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle, working itself out in a way that is customized for a time and place.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nToby Baxendale writes the introducton to this story that reads like a great novel.

The project centers on the Goddess Parvati and Priya, a mortal woman devotee and survivor of rape and is rooted in ancient matriarchal traditions that have been displaced in modern representations of Hindu culture. It creates an alternative narrative and voice against GBV in popular culture through the Hindu mythological canon. Through its message, this project can reach wide audiences in India and around the world—anywhere GBV is an issue.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nCentral to the project is an augmented reality (AR) comic book &amp; exhibition – the first of its kind with international outreach and social engagement. In the AR comic book, certain panels will be animated to feature real-life stories and voices of Indian women who have survived sexual assault and faced the ensuing trauma and social stigma. These pieces will be short documentaries, but the women will be animated in order to protect their identities and can be activated through a free AR APP. This project will help define the new frontier of integrating literary publications &amp; exhibitions with AR technology. The comic book will initially be available in Hindi, English &amp; Marathi but eventually will be translated into other languages.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe storyline focuses on Priya, a human woman and ardent devotee of the Goddess Parvati who has experienced a brutal rape and the social stigma and isolation resulting from it. The Goddess Parvati is horrified to learn about the sexual violence that women on Earth face on a daily basis and is determined to change this disturbing reality. Inspired by the Goddess, Priya breaks her silence. She sings a message of women’s empowerment that enraptures thousands and moves them to take action against GBV around the world. This project highlights the threat of sexual harassment and violence that women face on a daily basis unless deeply rooted patriarchal norms are challenged.\r\n.<br /><br />\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781892494399"],"id":143124,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/55/c7/55c75544ea12eb09e77b6e8ea51e4762.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/2674/?feed=opds","author":"Ram Devineni","isOwn":false},{"category":["Nonfiction","Psychology"],"updated":"2015-03-10T16:08:28","language":"en","title":"Control Your Dreams","issued":"2011","summary":"We tell you how to have lucid dreams.

Recent studies show that only one in four nurses feel confident in caring for dying patients and their families and less than 2% of overall content in nursing textbooks is related to end-of-life care, despite the tremendous growth in palliative and end-of-life care programs across the country. The purpose of this textbook is to provide an indepth look at death and dying in this country, including the vital role of the nurse in assisting patients and families along the journey towards the end of life. There is an emphasis throughout the book on the simple, yet understated value of effective interpersonal communication between the patient and clinician. The text provides a basic foundation of understanding death and dying, including a brief historical examination of some main conceptual models associated with how patients cope with impending loss. An overview of illness trajectories and models of care, such as hospice and palliative care are discussed. Lastly, the latest evidence-based approaches for pain and symptom management, ethical concerns, cultural considerations, care at the time of death, and grief/bereavement are examined.

These topics have been at the center of digital signal processing since its beginning, and new results in hardware, theory and applications continue to keep them important and exciting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as we can tell, Gauss was the first to propose the techniques that we now call the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for calculating the coefficients in a trigonometric expansion of an asteroid's orbit in 1805. However, it was the seminal paper by Cooley and Tukey in 1965 that caught the attention of the science and engineering community and, in a way, founded the discipline of digital signal processing (DSP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The impact of the Cooley-Tukey FFT was enormous. Problems could be solved quickly that were not even considered a few years earlier. A flurry of research expanded the theory and developed excellent practical programs as well as opening new applications. In 1976, Winograd published a short paper that set a second flurry of research in motion. This was another type of algorithm that expanded the data lengths that could be transformed efficiently and reduced the number of multiplications required. The ground work for this algorithm had be set earlier by Good and by Rader. In 1997 Frigo and Johnson developed a program they called the FFTW (fastest Fourier transform in the west) which is a composite of many of ideas in other algorithms as well as new results to give a robust, very fast system for general data lengths on a variety of computer and DSP architectures. This work won the 1999 Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is hard to overemphasis the importance of the DFT, convolution, and fast algorithms. With a history that goes back to Gauss and a compilation of references on these topics that in 1995 resulted in over 2400 entries, the FFT may be the most important numerical algorithm in science, engineering, and applied mathematics. New theoretical results still are appearing, advances in computers and hardware continually restate the basic questions, and new applications open new areas for research. It is hoped that this book will provide the background, references, programs and incentive to encourage further research and results in this area as well as provide tools for practical applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studying the FFT is not only valuable in understanding a powerful tool, it is also a prototype or example of how algorithms can be made efficient and how a theory can be developed to define optimality. The history of this development also gives insight into the process of research where timing and serendipity play interesting roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several chapters or sections are written by authors who have extensive experience and depth working on the particular topics. Ivan Selesnick had written several papers on the design of short FFTs to be used in the prime factor algorithm (PFA) FFT and on automatic design of these short FFTs. Markus Püschel has developed a theoretical framework for “Algebraic Signal Processing&quot; which allows a structured generation of FFT programs and a system called “Spiral&quot; for automatically generating algorithms specifically for an architicture. Steven Johnson along with his colleague Matteo Frigo created, developed, and now maintains the powerful FFTW system: the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West. I sincerely thank these authors for their significant contributions.</p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781300461647"],"id":155512,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=6skMBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3260/?feed=opds","author":"C.

Thus, depending on the neurofeedback protocol applied behavioural, cognitive and / or emotional effects can be induced. Different assumptions about mechanisms, moderators and mediators of neurofeedback exist, associated with different ways of application. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEEG-based neurofeedback is used as a therapeutic approach in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a clinically and pathophysiologically heterogeneous child psychiatric disorder. There is increasing evidence for specific effects of neurofeedback when applying 'standard' protocols (slow cortical potentials, theta/beta, SMR). Knowledge about underlying mechanisms and moderating variables is increasing. Nevertheless, further well-controlled and conducted trials are needed to answer open questions concerning optimisation and individualisation of neurofeedback training. Further improvements may be expected from new methodical and technical developments (e.g., tomographic neurofeedback) and new concepts (integrated ADHD treatment). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Frontiers Reserach Topic intends to provide answers to the following questions concerning neurofeedback in ADHD: <br />\r\n• How efficacious is neurofeedback / does a certain neurofeedback protocol work? <br />\r\n• What is the rationale of applying a certain neurofeedback protocol in ADHD? <br />\r\n• What are central mechanisms and which moderating variables may affect training outcome? <br />\r\n• How to optimise treatment?

They respond to music and learn through music. Music expresses children’s identity and heritage, teaches them to belong to a culture, and develops their cognitive well-being and inner self worth. As professional instructors, childcare workers, or students looking forward to a career working with children, we should continuously search for ways to tap into children’s natural reservoir of enthusiasm for singing, moving and experimenting with instruments. But how, you might ask? What music is appropriate for the children I’m working with? How can music help inspire a well-rounded child? How do I reach and teach children <em>musically</em>? Most importantly perhaps, how can I incorporate music into a curriculum that marginalizes the arts?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book explores a holistic, artistic, and integrated approach to understanding the developmental connections between music and children. This book guides professionals to work through music, harnessing the processes that underlie music learning, and outlining developmentally appropriate methods to understand the role of music in children’s lives through play, games, creativity, and movement.

This book draws not only on critical qualitative inquiry methods such as interview and observation, but also on theories and sensibilities from creative writing and performance studies, which encourage self-reflection and narrative composition. Concepts from qualitative inquiry studies, which examine everyday life, are combined with approaches to the creation of character and scene to help writers develop engaging narratives that examine chosen subcultures and the author’s position in relation to her research subjects. The book brings together a brief history of first-person qualitative research and writing from the past forty years, examining the evolution of nonfiction and qualitative approaches in relation to the personal essay. A selection of recent student writing in the genre as well as reflective student essays on the experience of conducting research in the classroom is presented in the context of exercises for coursework and beyond. Also explored in detail are guidelines for interviewing and identifying subjects and techniques for creating informed sketches and images that engage the reader. This book provides approaches anyone can use to explore their communities and write about them first-hand. The methods presented can be used for a single assignment in a larger course or to guide an entire semester through many levels and varieties of informed personal writing.</p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781942341284"],"id":200139,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23149/?feed=opds","author":"Melissa Tombro","isOwn":false},{"category":["Abolitionists","Abolitionists -- United States -- Biography","Accessible book","African American abolitionists","African American abolitionists -- Biography","African Americans","Antislavery movements","Biography","Biography & Autobiography","Classic Literature","Douglass, Frederick, 1818-1895","E300","Fiction","GITenberg","History","In library","Literature","Nonfiction","OverDrive","Protected DAISY","Slavery","Slaves","Slaves -- United States -- Biography","Social conditions","United States","Women slaves"],"publishers":[{"publisher":"Recovering the Classics"}],"updated":"2016-07-27T17:43:18","language":"en","title":"Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, an American slave","issued":"1845-2012","summary":"&quot;Now,&quot; said he, &quot;if you teach that nigger (speaking of myself) how to read, there would be no keeping him.

He is reputed to have been reading a comic book when he died.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780450025129","urn:ISBN:9780345315755","urn:ISBN:9780345258311","urn:ISBN:9780345289964","urn:ISBN:9780345241603","urn:ISBN:9781426450167","urn:ISBN:9781591940203","urn:ISBN:9781153746908","urn:ISBN:9780345281050"],"id":62608,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=6YurYgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4447/?feed=opds","author":"E.R.

Through his involvement with three women, Theron Ware, a small-town Methodist minister, finds that his abstract, absolute notions about himself and his world lead to doubt and confusion. Uncertain in his faith, Ware is alone and unprepared to meet the moral, scientific, and aesthetic ambiguities of the new century. Employing the documentary detail, pragmatic attitude, and comic vision of conventional realism, The Damnation of Theron Ware also foreshadows the rise of naturalism - and the works of Theodore Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis. As Scott Donaldson says in his Introduction, &quot;It would be hard to imagine a novel more sensitive to and reflective of the ideas and controversies coursing through the American eighteen-nineties.&quot; Book jacket.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140390254","urn:ISBN:9781573921695","urn:ISBN:9780674190016","urn:ISBN:9780375760358","urn:ISBN:9780030102004","urn:ISBN:9781599866307","urn:ISBN:9781463517113","urn:ISBN:9781426459009","urn:ISBN:9781605896960"],"id":62628,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=wD1VWO8qLMUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5012/?feed=opds","author":"Harold Frederic","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Adventure stories","Atlantis","Challenger, Professor (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","Children's literature, English","Dinosaurs","Dinosaurs -- Fiction","Discovery and exploration","English Detective and mystery stories","Fantasy fiction","Fiction","Fiction in English","Fiction in French","GITenberg","In library","Large type books","PR","Prehistoric peoples","Prehistoric peoples -- Fiction","Professor Challenger (Fictitious character)","Protected DAISY","Scientific expeditions","South America -- Fiction","Translations into Czech","Translations into Russian"],"updated":"2016-08-05T22:35:55","language":"en","title":"The Lost World","issued":"1912-2011","summary":"The Lost World, first published in 1912, tells the story of Professor Challenger, Professor Summerlee, adventurer Lord John Roxton, and reporter Ed Malone as they travel to a remote plateau in South America inhabited by dinosaurs, ape men, and prehistoric humans. In trying to escape from the dangerous creatures, some of them end up captured by the ape men, and the rest must mount a rescue. Fraught with action and suspense, The Lost World is one of the seminal works of dinosaur fiction. It has been the inspiration for numerous spinoffs and retellings, including television shows, radio shows, and movies. Readers of all ages will delight in this deftly told tale. Scottish surgeon and political activist SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE (1859-1930) turned his passions into stories and novels, producing fiction and nonfiction works sometimes controversial (The Great Boer War, 1900), sometimes fanciful (The Coming of the Fairies, 1922), and sometimes legendary (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, 1892).","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780425035146","urn:ISBN:9780812967258","urn:ISBN:9780141033778","urn:ISBN:9780812564839","urn:ISBN:9780140367485","urn:ISBN:9780486400600","urn:ISBN:9781403709851","urn:ISBN:9780141031293","urn:ISBN:9781153747004"],"id":62630,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=4fldPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5027/?feed=opds","author":"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","American Maxims","Biography","Childhood and youth","Children's literature, English","Correspondence","E300","Education","Franklin, Benjamin, 1706-1790","GITenberg","History","In library","Inventors","Literature","Maxims","Nonfiction","Philosophers","Politics and government","Portraits","Printers","Protected DAISY","Quakers","Scientists","Social conditions","Sources","Statesman","Statesmen","Statesmen -- United States -- Biography","Will","Wills"],"updated":"2016-08-05T22:38:53","language":"en","title":"The autobiography of Benjamin Franklin","issued":"1945-2011","summary":"Benjamin Franklin's writings represent a long career of literary, scientific, and political efforts over a lifetime which extended nearly the entire eighteenth century. Franklin's achievements range from inventing the lightning rod to publishing Poor Richard's Almanack to signing the Declaration of Independence. In his own lifetime he knew prominence not only in America but in Britain and France as well. This volume includes Franklin's reflections on such diverse questions as philosophy and religion, social status, electricity, American national characteristics, war, and the status of women. Nearly sixty years separate the earliest writings from the latest, an interval during which Franklin was continually balancing between the puritan values of his upbringing and the modern American world to which his career served as prologue. This edition provides a new text of the Autobiography, established with close reference to Franklin's original manuscript. It also includes a new transcription of the 1726 journal, and several pieces which have recently been identified as Franklin's own work.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780300098587","urn:ISBN:9780486290737","urn:ISBN:9780743255066","urn:ISBN:9780140390520","urn:ISBN:9780553210750","urn:ISBN:9780760768617","urn:ISBN:9780142437605","urn:ISBN:9780451524973","urn:ISBN:9781936594375"],"id":62640,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=TUUvLQxzoKoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5039/?feed=opds","author":"Benjamin Franklin","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Albatrosses","Animal welfare","Children's literature, English","English poetry","English Sea poetry","GITenberg","History and criticism","Human-animal relationships","Illustrated books, Children's","Illustrations","In library","Literature","Older men","Penance","Poetry","PR","Protected DAISY","Sailors","Sea poetry","Seafaring life","Specimens","Textual Criticism","The rime of the ancient mariner (Coleridge)"],"updated":"2016-08-05T22:39:43","language":"en","title":"The rime of the ancient mariner","issued":"1949-2010","summary":"Coleridge's celebrated poem was written at the suggestion of William Wordsworth in the early days of their friendship, and published for the first time in 1798. It is the story of a nightmare voyage to the South Pole told by the sole survivor, the bright-eyed ancient mariner whose wanton killing of an albatross,a bird of good omen, brought misfortune on the ship and all its crew. Coleridge's own commentary on the dateful drama, written some years later at a time of renewed religious feeling, is printed alongside the poem. The poem is brilliantly illustrated with a sequence of specially commissioned drawings by Mervyn Peake. His powerful, arresting images perfectly express the qualities of the text, its gothic atmosphere and supernatural terrors, ultimately softened by pity and the hope of redemption.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780486223056","urn:ISBN:9781562650162","urn:ISBN:9780785823407","urn:ISBN:9780304356171","urn:ISBN:9781857995510","urn:ISBN:9780517118498","urn:ISBN:9780380009992","urn:ISBN:9781841938509","urn:ISBN:9780920256022"],"id":62641,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=1hYOAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5045/?feed=opds","author":"Samuel Taylor Coleridge","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Classic Literature","Country homes","Country homes -- Fiction","Detective and mystery stories","Diamonds","Drama","East Indians","East Indians -- England -- Fiction","England -- Fiction","English fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","History","In library","Jewelry theft","Jewelry theft -- Fiction","Juvenile literature","Literature","Mystery fiction","OverDrive","Police","Police -- England -- Fiction","PR","Protected DAISY","Readers","Upper class","Young women"],"updated":"2016-07-27T14:38:46","language":"en","title":"The Moonstone","issued":"1953-2012","summary":"Title: The Moonstone: a dramatic story, in three acts.

Edna is an upper-middle class woman who has married into the Creole elite when she begins to believe that there is more to life than societal status and frivolous wealth. At Grand Isle she enters into an extramarital relationship with Robert LeBrun, the son of the woman who runs the resort. She flirts with Robert and seeks his support of her dissatisfaction with materialism, until he realizes it is apparent that something must be done to shake her constant attention to him. He &quot;decides&quot; to go to Mexico. Edna is lonesome when he leaves, but on her return to New Orleans with her family, she suddenly starts to do things differently: she will not receive guests or makes social calls; she starts drawing and painting; she takes lessons on the piano with the notoriously unpleasant Mademoiselle Reisz who also listens to Edna's reading of Robert's letters. Her husband leaves for New York on a long business trip, and Edna sees her chance to move out of his house into a place of her own. She throws herself a going away party and discovers that Robert is returning. She is then called to her friend Adele's house to help with the delivery of her latest child. Being witness to the birth has a terrible effect on Edna. In the meantime, she learns that Robert, despite all his promises of love, has left her. She experiences an &quot;awakening&quot; of her awareness of the truth surrounding her entire situation. She travels alone to Grand Isle, goes out swimming, naked, into the ocean, giving herself over to memories of the past and to drowing.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780671015473","urn:ISBN:9780380002450","urn:ISBN:9780553213300","urn:ISBN:9780486277868","urn:ISBN:9780704347335","urn:ISBN:9781438242927","urn:ISBN:9781438260990","urn:ISBN:9780543898081","urn:ISBN:9781936594498"],"id":62648,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=oc5gPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4780/?feed=opds","author":"Kate Chopin","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Avarice","Avarice -- Fiction","Dentists","Dentists -- Fiction","Didactic fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Greed","In library","Literature","Married people","Married people -- Fiction","Murderers","Murderers -- Fiction","Protected DAISY","PS","Psychological fiction","San Francisco (Calif.) -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-05T22:48:36","language":"en","title":"McTeague","issued":"1899-2011","summary":"Inspired by an actual crime that was sensationalized in the San Francisco papers, this novel tells the story of charlatan dentist McTeague and his wife Trina, and their spiralling descent into moral corruption.

The case, I may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion - an appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in the terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had shaken him. It was this observation that drew from Douglas - not immediately, but later in the evening - a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention. Someone else told a story not particu-larly effective, which I saw he was not following. This I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait.

Lawrence's great autobiographical novel is a provocative portrait of an artist torn between love for his possessive mother and desire for two young beautiful women. Set in the Nottinghamshire coal fields of Lawrence's own boyhood, the story of young Paul Morel's growing into manhood in a British working-class family rife with conflict reveals both an inner and an outer world seething with intense emotions. Gertrude is Paul's puritanical mother who concentrates all her love and attention on her son Paul. She nurtures his talents as a painter - and when she broods that he might marry someday and desert her, he swears he will never leave her. Inevitably, Paul does fall in love, but with two women - and is unable to choose between them. Written early in Lawrence's literary career, Sons and Lovers possesses all the powers of description, insistent sensuality, and scathing social criticism that are the special hallmarks of his genius. &quot;A work of striking originality,&quot; writes the critic F.R.

It had been a day of wild November wind, closing down into a wet, eerie twilight. Outside, the wind was shrilling at the windows and around the eaves, and the rain was playing on the roof. The old willow at the gate was writhing in the storm and the orchard was a place of weird music, born of all the tears and fears that haunt the halls of night. But little we cared for the gloom and the loneliness of the outside world; we kept them at bay with the light of the fire and the laughter of our young lips. We had been having a splendid game of Blind-Man's Buff. That is, it had been splendid at first; but later the fun went out of it because we found that Peter was, of malice prepense, allowing himself to be caught too easily, in order that he might have the pleasure of catching Felicity-which he never failed to do, no matter how tightly his eyes were bound.

Frank Baum's Oz series. It was the first in which Baum was clearly intending a series of Oz books. Where at the end of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Dorothy's silver shoes were lost in the desert, at the end of Ozma of Oz, Glinda tells her the magic belt she could wish herself home with would likewise be lost, and Dorothy carefully gives it to Princess Ozma, in order that she might go home but the magic still be preserved, and they arrange that Ozma will use it to wish Dorothy back to Oz at need. It is also the first book where the majority of the action takes place outside of the Land of Oz. Only the final two chapters take place in Oz itself. This reflects a subtle change in theme: in the first book, Oz is the dangerous land through which Dorothy must win her way back to Kansas; in the third, Oz is the end and aim of the book. Dorothy's desire to return home is not as desperate as in the first book, and it is her uncle's need for her rather than hers for him that makes her return. It was illustrated throughout in color by artist John R. Neill. The book bore the following dedication: &quot;To all the boys and girls who read my stories - and especially to the Dorothys - this book is lovingly dedicated.&quot;","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780091201906","urn:ISBN:9780688066321","urn:ISBN:9780345335890","urn:ISBN:9780345282255","urn:ISBN:9780486247793","urn:ISBN:9780064409629","urn:ISBN:9780816707966","urn:ISBN:9781173247270","urn:ISBN:9780543895141"],"id":64656,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=wXapPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5738/?feed=opds","author":"L.

The shepherd's dog barked fiercely when one of these alien-looking men appeared on the upland, dark against the early winter sunset; for what dog likes a figure bent under a heavy bag? - and these pale men rarely stirred abroad without that mysterious burden. The shepherd himself, though he had good reason to believe that the bag held nothing but flaxen thread, or else the long rolls of strong linen spun from that thread, was not quite sure that this trade of weaving, indispensable though it was, could be carried on entirely without the help of the Evil One. In that far-off time superstition clung easily round every person or thing that was at all unwonted, or even intermittent and occasional merely, like the visits of the pedlar or the knife-grinder. No one knew where wandering men had their homes or their origin; and how was a man to be explained unless you at least knew somebody who knew his father and mother? To the peasants of old times, the world outside their own direct experience was a region of vagueness and mystery: to their untravelled thought a state of wandering was a conception as dim as the winter life of the swallows that came back with the spring; and even a settler, if he came from distant parts, hardly ever ceased to be viewed with a remnant of distrust, which would have prevented any surprise if a long course of inoffensive conduct on his part had ended in the commission of a crime; especially if he had any reputation for knowledge, or showed any skill in handicraft. All cleverness, whether in the rapid use of that difficult instrument the tongue, or in some other art unfamiliar to villagers, was in itself suspicious: honest folk, born and bred in a visible manner, were mostly not overwise or clever - at least, not beyond such a matter as knowing the signs of the weather; and the process by which rapidity and dexterity of any kind were acquired was so wholly hidden, that they partook of the nature of conjuring. In this way it came to pass that those scattered linen-weavers - emigrants from the town into the country - were to the last regarded as aliens by their rustic neighbours, and usually contracted the eccentric habits which belong to a state of loneliness.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781580493451","urn:ISBN:9780451530622","urn:ISBN:9780553212297","urn:ISBN:9780141439754","urn:ISBN:9780140430301","urn:ISBN:9780451527219","urn:ISBN:9780486292465","urn:ISBN:9781853262210","urn:ISBN:9780140620917"],"id":64794,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=wzFnjQoxGiQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5913/?feed=opds","author":"George Eliot","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Children's literature, English","England -- Fiction","English fiction","English literature","Fiction","GITenberg","Humorous stories","In library","Inglés","Libros de lectura","Literatura inglesa","Literature","Male friendship","Male friendship -- Fiction","Men","Men -- Societies and clubs -- Fiction","PR","Protected DAISY","Readers","Selections, extracts","Social life and customs","Societies and clubs","Travelers","Trials (Breach of promise)"],"updated":"2016-08-06T18:00:49","language":"en","title":"The Pickwick papers","issued":"1837-2012","summary":"The first ray of light which illumines the gloom, and converts into a dazzling brilliancy that obscurity in which the earlier history of the public career of the immortal Pickwick would appear to be involved, is derived from the perusal of the following entry in the Transactions of the Pickwick Club, which the editor of these papers feels the highest pleasure in laying before his readers, as a proof of the careful attention, indefatigable assiduity, and nice discrimination, with which his search among the multifarious documents confided to him has been conducted. &quot;May 12, 1827.

It tells of the experiences of a young Scotsman who travels to South Africa at the dawn of the 20th century to make his fortune in the wild plains of an untamed country. Part mystery, part travelogue, part spy novel, part treasure hunt, it has all the makings of a crackling good read. It is firm proof that John Buchan (The Thirty-Nine Steps, Greenmantle, and so many other novels of intrigue) remains a storyteller of the first order. His writing style is fresh and compelling.The events transpire in a critical time South African history, just as the Dutch are about to lose control of Transvaal to the British, but the focus of the story is not on the Dutch or the British. They merely serve as the backdrop for the real action, the arrival of a charismatic black leader, John Laputa, who vows to unite all of Africa under him. Heralding himself the rightful heir of Prester John, the legendary medieval King of Ethiopia said to be a descendant of one of the three Magi. Laputa uses the Prester John myth to rally his forces and fuel his insurgency, but in the end it becomes a case of spears and shields versus bolt-action rifles.This is not Laputa's narrative, however. The story belongs to young Mr. David Crawfurd, of Kirkcaple, Scotland. As a stranger in a strange land Crawfurd must draw on his inner strength and resources to survive the explosive conflict around him. Prester John is a top-notch adventure story, full of daring heroes and wondrous villainsa forgotten gem of early 20th Century literature.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781404325036","urn:ISBN:9780140011388","urn:ISBN:9781842327852","urn:ISBN:9781611040937","urn:ISBN:9781846970641","urn:ISBN:9781600969881","urn:ISBN:9781406589993","urn:ISBN:9781419142895","urn:ISBN:9781438501017"],"id":64806,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=JeA6PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6086/?feed=opds","author":"John Buchan","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Boston (Mass.) -- Fiction","Fiction","Forecasts","GITenberg","In library","Literature","Protected DAISY","PS","Science Fiction","Social problems","Social problems -- Fiction","Time travel","Time travel -- Fiction","Twentieth century","Two thousand, A.D.","Two thousand, A.D. -- Fiction","Utopian Fiction","Utopias","Utopias -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T18:37:30","language":"en","title":"Looking Backward 2000-1887","issued":"1888-2011","summary":"Meet Julian West, who falls asleep in Boston for over a hundred years... then wakes to find himself in a futuristic socialist utopia, where people retire at 45 to live out the rest of their lives in leisure. His guide in this brave new America is Doctor Leete, with whom he discusses the wonders he encounters and the perils he envisions. These social-minded dialogues range from discussing religion, an improved legal system and class equality, to the use of credit cards, overnight deliveries, and the dangers of the stock market. Edward Bellamy wrote &quot;Looking Backward&quot; in 1887, and the descriptions of his futuristic socialist utopia quickly ignited spirited debate, and led to a political movement which came to be known as Nationalism. The book also inspired the creation of new utopian communities, as well as influencing over a century of urban planning, including the Garden city movement in England. This full size collectible edition has been designed for students and scholars, and features a new introduction, as well as a contemporary look at the life and influence of Edward Bellamy. It has been updated and completely restored for a modern audience. Excerpt from &quot;Looking Backward by Edward Bellamy - A Utopian Novel&quot; (Chapter 26) Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. &quot;It was the sincere belief of even the best of men at that epoch that the only stable elements in human nature, on which a social system could be safely founded, were its worst propensities. They had been taught and believed that greed and self-seeking were all that held mankind together, and that all human associations would fall to pieces if anything were done to blunt the edge of these motives or curb their operation. In a word, they believed - even those who longed to believe otherwise - the exact reverse of what to us seems self-evident; they believed, that is, that the antisocial qualities of men, and not their social qualities, were what furnished the cohesive force of society.... It seems absurd to expect anyone to believe that convictions like these were ever seriously entertained by men....&quot; &quot;With a tear for the dark past, turn we then to the dazzling future, and, veiling our eyes, press forward. The long and weary winter of the race is ended. Its summer has begun. Humanity has burst the chrysalis. The heavens are before it.&quot; Critical reviews for Looking Backward &quot;&quot;One of the most remarkable books ever published in America... it is one of the few books ever published that created almost immediately on its appearance a political mass movement.&quot;&quot; --Erich Fromm &quot;&quot;While almost prophetic in its 19th century predictions of many modern contrivances, socially, 'Looking Backward' stands in stark contrast to America as it exists in the grip of the early 21st century world economic recession. Yet even more than a century after it was written, Bellamy's masterpiece now burns even brighter as a beacon of hope for class equality and the ideas associated with Christian socialism.&quot;&quot; --Shawn Conners, editor of &quot;Men &amp; Women by Robert Browning - Transcendentalism: A Poem in Twelve Books&quot;","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780674539006","urn:ISBN:9780140390186","urn:ISBN:9780451527639","urn:ISBN:9780486290386","urn:ISBN:9780451524126","urn:ISBN:9781420925708","urn:ISBN:9781557095060","urn:ISBN:9780451518866","urn:ISBN:9781551114064"],"id":64809,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=VIDdjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6119/?feed=opds","author":"Edward Bellamy","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","England -- Fiction","English Humorous stories","English Satire","Fiction","GITenberg","In library","Literature","Marketing","Patent medicines","Patent medicines -- Marketing -- Fiction","Pharmaceutical industry","Pharmaceutical industry -- Fiction","Pharmacists","PR","Protected DAISY","Satire","Science Fiction","Upper class","Upper classes"],"updated":"2016-08-06T19:38:28","language":"en","title":"Tono-Bungay","issued":"1953-2011","summary":"A highly imaginative satire of the business and advertising worlds, starring a hapless scientist and a scheming quack George Ponderevo, a student of science, is enlisted to help with the promotion of Tono-Bungay. Tono-Bungay is a harmful stimulant disguised as a miraculous cure-all, the creation of his ambitious uncle Edward. As the tonic prospers, George experiences a swift rise in social status, elevating him to riches and opportunities that he had never imagined, nor indeed desired. Meanwhile, George ricochets romantically between his unsuccessful marriage to Marion, his affair with the liberated Effie, and his doomed relationship with the Hon. Beatrice Normandy, a childhood friend. But the Tono-Bungay empire eventually over-extends itself and George must try to prop up his uncle's finances by stealing the radioactive compound &quot;quap&quot; from an island near Africa. Social satire in the best tradition of Evelyn Waugh, but with elements of futuristic science, this is an excellent crossover book for Wells's sci-fi fans.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780141441115","urn:ISBN:9780330200479","urn:ISBN:9780812967500","urn:ISBN:9780192828293","urn:ISBN:9780460872591","urn:ISBN:9780803297012","urn:ISBN:9780451503534","urn:ISBN:9780766169760","urn:ISBN:9780803247024"],"id":65214,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=h7JH4kWw0CoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6356/?feed=opds","author":"Herbert George Wells","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Civilization","D","GITenberg","History","Juvenile literature","Nonfiction","World history","World history -- Juvenile literature"],"updated":"2016-08-06T20:02:32","language":"en","title":"The story of mankind","issued":"1968-2010","summary":"History is the mighty Tower of Experience, which Time has built amidst the endless fields of bygone ages. It is no easy task to reach the top of this ancient structure and get the benefit of the full view. There is no elevator, but young feet are strong and it can be done. -Hendrik Van Loon, in the Foreword to The Story of Mankind It was intended for children, and of course much of the science is hopelessly out of date, but this ambitious, even audacious attempt to offer an overview of the entirety of human history remains a breathtaking work today. A 1921 bestseller, The Story of Mankind won the first Newbery Medal in 1922, and it is no wonder: the book-which begins with the origin of life itself on our planet and the arrival of the earliest protohumans on the scene and ends with &quot;The Last Fifty Years, Including Several Explanations and an Apology&quot;-is abundant with an offbeat charm and packed with the author's own beautiful illustrations and maps that are alive with a fresh, delectable humor. As a document of early modern science writing, it is invaluable. As a delightfully entertaining read, it is not to be missed. AUTHOR BIO: Dutch-American author and educator Hendrik Willem van Loon (1882-1944) sold more than six million books during his lifetime, including The Story of the Bible (1923), Tolerance (1925), and America (1927). After studies at Harvard, Cornell, and the University of Munich, he had a diverse career as a popular professor of European history at Cornell and of social sciences at Antioch College, an Associated Press correspondent in revolutionary Russia and World War I Belgium, and associate editor of the Baltimore Sun from 1923 to 1924. In appreciation for his dedicatedanti-Nazi writing during World War II, he was awarded the Order of Knight of the Netherlands Lion.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780871401717","urn:ISBN:9780871401755","urn:ISBN:9780871401564","urn:ISBN:9781599152110","urn:ISBN:9780871406477","urn:ISBN:9780871405470","urn:ISBN:9781849026000","urn:ISBN:9781406838169","urn:ISBN:9781604594126"],"id":65216,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=lnYxKwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6461/?feed=opds","author":"Hendrik Willem Van Loon","isOwn":false},{"category":["Brothers and sisters","Brothers and sisters -- Fiction","Brothers and sisters in fiction","Family life","Family life -- England -- Fiction","Family life in fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Great Britain -- History -- 19th century -- Fiction","Great Britain in fiction","History","Imagination","Imagination -- Fiction","Imagination in fiction","Moneymaking projects","Moneymaking projects -- Fiction","Moneymaking projects in fiction","PR","PZ"],"updated":"2016-08-06T20:08:27","language":"en","title":"The story of the treasure seekers","issued":"1958-2011","summary":"Edith Nesbit (married name Edith Bland) (1858-1924) was an English author and poet whose children's works were published under the androgynous name of E. Nesbit. She wrote or collaborated on over 60 books of fiction for children, several of which have been adapted for film and television. She started a new genre of magical adventures arising from everyday settings and has been much imitated. She was also a political activist and co-founded the Fabian Society, a precursor to the modern Labour Party. Nesbit's books for children are known for being entertaining without turning didactic, although some of her earlier works, notably Five Children and It (1902) and even more so The Story of the Amulet (1906), veer in that direction. Among Nesbit's best-known books are The Story of the Treasure Seekers (1898), The Wouldbegoods (1899) and The Railway Children (1906). Other works include The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904), The Enchanted Castle (1907) and The Magic City (1910).","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780361057394","urn:ISBN:9780140367065","urn:ISBN:9780140301168","urn:ISBN:9780811854153","urn:ISBN:9780140350586","urn:ISBN:9780811854160","urn:ISBN:9781858137957","urn:ISBN:9781853261657","urn:ISBN:9781598181722"],"id":65219,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=JDNvPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6491/?feed=opds","author":"Edith Nesbit","isOwn":false},{"category":[" 20th century","Accessible book","Air warfare","Air warfare -- Fiction","Classic Literature","English Science fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","OverDrive","PR","Science Fiction","War stories"],"updated":"2016-08-06T20:13:33","language":"en","title":"The War in the Air","issued":"1975-2011","summary":"The reader should grasp clearly the date at which this book was written. It was done in 1907: it appeared in various magazines as a serial in 1908 and it was published in the Fall of that year. At that time the airplane was, for most people, merely a rumor and the &quot;Sausage&quot; held the air. The contemporary reader has all the advantage of ten years' experience since this story was imagined. He can correct his author at a dozen points and estimate the value of these warnings by the standard of a decade of realities. The book is weak on anti-aircraft guns, for example, and still more negligent of submarines. Much, no doubt, will strike the reader as quaint and limited but upon much the writer may not unreasonably plume himself. The interpretation of the German spirit must have read as a caricature in 1908. Was it a caricature? Prince Karl seemed a fantasy then. Reality has since copied Prince Karl with an astonishing faithfulness. Is it too much to hope that some democratic &quot;Bert&quot; may not ultimately get even with his Highness? Our author tells us in this book, as he has told us in others, more especially in &quot;The World Set Free,&quot; and as he has been telling us this year in his &quot;War&quot; and the Future,&quot; that if mankind goes on with war, the smash-up of civilization is inevitable.

Excerpt from book: CHAPTER TIL ON THE ROAD. The bright morning sun dazzled the eyes, the snow had ceased, the mists had vanished, the mountain air was Bo clear and light that the new sensation of breathing it was like the having entered on a new existence. To help the delusion, the solid ground itself seemed gone, and the mountain, a shining waste of immense white heaps and masses, to be a region of cloud floating between the blue sky above and the earth far below. Some dark specks in the snow, like knots upon a little thread, beginning at the convent door and winding away down the descent in broken lengths which were not yet pieced together, showed where the Brethren were at work in several places clearing the track. Already the snow had begun to be foot-thawed again about the door. Mules were busily brought out, tied to the rings in the wall, and laden; strings of bells were buckled on, burdens were adjusted, the voices of drivers and riders sounded musically. Some of the earliest had even already resumed their journey; and, both on the level summit by the dark water near the convent, and on the downward way of yesterday's ascent, little moving figures of men and mules, reduced to miniatures by the immensity around, went with a clear tinkling of bells and a pleasant harmony of tongues. In the supper-room of last night, a new fire piled upon .he feathery ashes of the old one, shone upon a homely breakfast of loaves, butter, and milk. It also shone on the courier of the Dorrit family, making tea for his party from a supply he had brought up with him, together with several other small stores which were chiefly laid in for the use of the strong body of inconvenience. Mr. Gowan, and Blandois of Paris, had already breakfasted, and were walking up and down by the lake, smoking their cigars. ...","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780460876827","urn:ISBN:9780141439969","urn:ISBN:9780375759147","urn:ISBN:9781853261824","urn:ISBN:9780192545121","urn:ISBN:9780679417255","urn:ISBN:9780143115878","urn:ISBN:9780140434927","urn:ISBN:9781435116429"],"id":65255,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=q1NmPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7022/?feed=opds","author":"Charles Dickens","isOwn":false},{"category":["Allegories","Biographical fiction","English language","Fiction","GITenberg","Historical fiction","History","Netherlands -- History -- 1648-1714 -- Fiction","PQ","Readers","Study and teaching","Tulip Mania, 1634-1637","Tulip Mania, 1634-1637 -- Fiction","Tulip mania, 17th century","Witt, Johan de, 1625-1672","Witt, Johan de, 1625-1672 -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-08T14:15:02","language":"en","title":"The black tulip","issued":"1960-2011","summary":"Cornelius van Baerle, a respectable tulip-grower, lives only to cultivate the elusive black tulip and win the magnificent prize for its creation. But after his powerful godfather is assassinated, the unwitting Cornelius becomes caught up in deadly political intrigue and is falsely accused of high treason by a bitter rival. Condemned to life imprisonment, his only comfort is Rosa, the jailer’s beautiful daughter, and together they concoct a plan to grow the black tulip in secret. Dumas’s last major historical novel is a tale of romantic love, jealousy and obsession, interweaving historical events surrounding the brutal murders of two Dutch statesmen in 1672 with the phenomenon of ‘Tulipomania’ that gripped seventeenth-century Holland. This new translation follows the unabridged edition of 1865 and includes a chronology and list of further reading. In his introduction, Robin Buss discusses Dumas' use of elements from the history of the Dutch Republic, ‘Tulipomania’ and the paintings of the period, and places the novel in the context of Dumas' life and career.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780583117951","urn:ISBN:9780140448924","urn:ISBN:9781600961205","urn:ISBN:9780192837509","urn:ISBN:9780199540464","urn:ISBN:9780192830791","urn:ISBN:9781595479303","urn:ISBN:9781463604738","urn:ISBN:9780582534797"],"id":65256,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=OdLPjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7025/?feed=opds","author":"Alexandre Dumas","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Alcoholics","Alcoholics -- Fiction","Domestic fiction","England -- Fiction","England -- Social life and customs -- 19th century -- Fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","In library","Landlord and tenant","Landlord and tenant -- Fiction","Married women","Married women -- Fiction","PR","Protected DAISY"],"updated":"2016-08-08T14:18:18","language":"en","title":"The tenant of Wildfell Hall","issued":"1914-2012","summary":"Combining a sensational story of a man's physical and moral decline through alcohol, a study of marital breakdown, a disquisition on the care and upbringing of children, and a hard-hitting critique of the position of women in Victorian society, this passionate tale of betrayal is set within a stern moral framework tempered by Anne Bronte's optimistic belief in universal redemption. It tells the story of the estranged wife of a dissolute rake, desperate to protect her son from his destructive influence, in full flight from a shocking world of debauchery and cruelty. Drawing on her first-hand experiences with her brother Branwell, Bronte's novel scandalized contemporary readers and still retains its power to shock today. The new introduction by Josephine McDonagh sheds light on the intellectual and cultural context of the novel, its complex narrative structure, and the contemporary moral and medical debates about alcohol and the body with which the novel engages. Based on the authoritative Clarendon text, the book has an improved chronology, an up-to-date bibliography, and many informative notes.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780198125969","urn:ISBN:9780199207558","urn:ISBN:9780140434743","urn:ISBN:9780192834621","urn:ISBN:9781853264887","urn:ISBN:9780140620436","urn:ISBN:9781853260926","urn:ISBN:9781419184970","urn:ISBN:9780192829894"],"id":65257,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=kPMdAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7040/?feed=opds","author":"Anne Brontë","isOwn":false},{"category":["Avarice -- Fiction","Children's literature, English","Fiction","GITenberg","PR","Shipwrecks -- Fiction","Treasure troves -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-08T14:49:23","language":"en","title":"The Wrecker","issued":"1892-2011","summary":"Robert Louis Stevenson was a Scottish essayist, poet, novelist, and travel writer.

The entire story takes place as the characters travel by bicycle through the English countryside, in the brief halcyon era between the invention of the bicycle and the advent of the automobile. The shy Mr. Hoopdriver perceives that the Lady in Grey is being seduced by her supposed protector, and over the course of several days and many miles of cycling, he gallantly comes to her aid. With hilarious descriptions of the early days of cycling, a romping plot of high adventure, and H. G.

Excerpt from book: CHAPTER II MORNING ON THE BEACH THE THREE LETTERS The clouds were all fled, the beauty of the tropic day was spread upon Papeete; and the wall of breaking seas upon the reef, and the palms upon the islet, already trembled in the heat. A French man-of-war was going out, homeward bound; she lay in the middle distance of the port, an ant-heap for activity. In the night a schooner had come in, and now lay far out, hard by the passage; and the yellow flag, the emblem of pestilence, flew on her. From up the coast, a long procession of canoes headed round the point and towards the market, bright as a scarf with the many-coloured clothing of the natives and the piles of fruit. But not even the beauty and the welcome warmth of the morning, not even these naval movements, so interesting to sailors and to idlers, could engage the attention of the outcasts. They were still cold at heart, theirmouths sour from the want of sleep, their steps rambling from the lack of food; and they strung like lame geese along the beach in a disheartened silence. It was towards the town they moved; towards the town whence smoke arose, where happier folk were breakfasting; and as they went, their hungry eyes were upon all sides, but they were only scouting for a meal. A small and dingy schooner lay snug against the quay, with which it was connected by a plank. On the forward deck, under a spot of awning, five Kanakas who made up the crew, were squatted round a basin of fried feis,1 and drinking coffee from tin mugs. ' Eight bells: knock off for breakfast!' cried the captain with a miserable heartiness. ' Never tried this craft before; positively my first appearance; guess I 'll draw a bumper house.' He came close up to where the plank rested on the grassy quay; turned his back upon the schoo...","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780809566327","urn:ISBN:9780460875356","urn:ISBN:9780748604760","urn:ISBN:9780217756587","urn:ISBN:9781406817973","urn:ISBN:9781406582048","urn:ISBN:9788475840291","urn:ISBN:9781141094141","urn:ISBN:9781434456007"],"id":66083,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=6fdNPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8583/?feed=opds","author":"Robert Louis Stevenson","isOwn":false},{"category":["Detective and mystery stories, English","Fiction","GITenberg","PR","Private investigators -- England -- London -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-09T19:54:59","language":"en","title":"Club of Queer Trades","issued":"1946-2011","summary":"","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780786264223","urn:ISBN:9780486255347","urn:ISBN:9781853262609","urn:ISBN:9781843914341","urn:ISBN:9780140183870","urn:ISBN:9780881843200","urn:ISBN:9781434400321","urn:ISBN:9781604245769","urn:ISBN:9781148710228"],"id":99512,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=xJenPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8841/?feed=opds","author":"G.

A typical &quot;locked room mystery,&quot; the novel features characters who may not be all they seem to be, acting for mysterious motives ranging from love to revenge. Servants overhear bits of conversation which offer clues. The discovery of a secret passage, the appearance of a ghost, and a convenient lake to hide evidence all become part of the plot. Written in 1922, before Winnie the Pooh was even born, &quot;The Red House Mystery&quot; was a gift for Milne's father, a retired headmaster who loved mysteries. The book was immediately popular; Alexander Woollcott called it &quot;one of the three best mystery stories of all time&quot;, and Raymond Chandler, in his 1944 essay The Simple Art of Murder called it &quot;an agreeable book, light, amusing in the Punch style, written with a deceptive smoothness that is not as easy as it looks.&quot;","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781905432905","urn:ISBN:9780486401294","urn:ISBN:9780440173762","urn:ISBN:9780099521266","urn:ISBN:9780099521273","urn:ISBN:9781579247027","urn:ISBN:9781419180019","urn:ISBN:9781449595142","urn:ISBN:9781434616517"],"id":66112,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=mIEuPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/9319/?feed=opds","author":"A.

Based on the author's own experiences, as well as oral and written sources, in the South Seas, Melville's story of two runaway sailors held captive by the Typees is a vivid portrait of Polynesian life. Many readers delighted in its racy scenes, but religious fundamentalists saw to it that criticism of missionaries was expurgated from the American text. Five years later, the religious press took revenge on Moby-Dick when Melville again displayed his persistent skepticism and irreverence and celebrated cultural relativity as he had done in Typee. As Melville's fame declined after the 1850s, readers forgot the old religious denunciations and remembered Typee as the best of his books. Throughout his lifetime, Melville's most famous and popular character was Fayaway. This text of Typee is an Approved Text of the Center for Editions of American Authors (Modern Language Association of America).

Excerpt from book: Mrs. Pontifex had no sense of humour, at least I can call to mind no signs of this, but her husband had plenty of fun in him, though few would have guessed it from his appearance. I remember my father once sent me down to his workshop to get some glue, and I happened to come when old Pontifex was in the act of scolding his boy. He had got the lad?a pudding-headed fellow?by the ear and was saying, &quot;What ? Lost again?smothered o' wit.&quot; (I believe it was the boy who was himself supposed to be a wandering soul, and who was thus addressed as lost.) &quot;Now, look here, my lad,&quot; he continued, &quot;some boys are born stupid, and thou art one of them; some achieve stupidity?that's thee again, Jim? thou wast both born stupid and hast greatly increased thy birthright?and some&quot; (and here came a climax during which the boy's head and ear were swayed from side to side) &quot;have stupidity thrust upon them, which, if it please the Lord, shall not be thy case, my lad, for I will thrust stupidity from thee, though I have to box thine ears in doing so,&quot; ut I did not see that the old man really did box Jim's ears, or do more than pretend to frighten him, for the two understood one another perfectly well. Another time I remember hearing him call the village ratcatcher by saying, &quot;Come hither, thou three-days-and- three-nights, thou,&quot; alluding, as I afterwards learned, to the rat-catcher's periods of intoxication; but I will tell no more of such trifles. My father's face would always brighten when old Pontifex's name was mentioned. &quot;I tell you, Edward,&quot; he would say to me, &quot;old Pontifex was not only an able man, but he was one of the very ablest men that ever I knew.&quot; This was more than I as a young man was prepared to stand. &quot;My dear father,&quot; I answered, &quot;what did he do?

This, then, was he whom Mary loved. It was, perhaps, no wonder; for he seemed to the poor smith so elegant, so well-appointed, that he felt the superiority in externals, strangely and painfully, for an instant. Then something uprose within him, and told him that &quot;a man's a man for a' that, for a' that, and twice as much a' that.&quot; And he no longer felt troubled by the outward appearance of his rival. -from Chapter XV As interest in 19th-century English literature by women has been reinvigorated by a resurgence in popularity of the works of Jane Austen, readers are rediscovering a writer whose fiction, once widely beloved, fell by the wayside. British novelist ELIZABETH CLEGHORN GASKELL (1810-1865)-whose books were sometimes initially credited to, simply, &quot;Mrs. Gaskell&quot;-is now recognized as having created some of the most complex and broadminded depictions of women in the literature of the age, and is today justly celebrated for her precocious use of the regional dialect and slang of England's industrial North. Mary Barton-Gaskell's first novel, originally published anonymously in 1848-established her reputation as a champion of the working class. Set in Manchester, where the author herself settled as the wife of a progressive preacher, it concerns the trials and tribulations of two poor families, the Bartons and the Wilsons, and a tragedy that cements their joint fate and highlights the class divide in highly stratified Victorian society. Friend and literary companion to the likes of Charles Dickens and Charlotte Bront-the latter of whom Gaskell wrote an acclaimed 1857biography-Gaskell is today being restored to her rightful place alongside them. This charming replica volume is an excellent opportunity for 21st-century fans of British literature to embrace one of its most unjustly forgotten authors.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780192835109","urn:ISBN:9780140434644","urn:ISBN:9780140430530","urn:ISBN:9780192805621","urn:ISBN:9780140621020","urn:ISBN:9780199538355","urn:ISBN:9780192817501","urn:ISBN:9781551111698","urn:ISBN:9781420933369"],"id":5635,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=2fNwMkq1g8sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10129/?feed=opds","author":"Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Children's literature, English","Epistolary fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Great Britain -- Fiction","In library","Literature","PR","Protected DAISY","Travelers","Travelers -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-23T12:08:43","language":"en","title":"The expedition of Humphry Clinker","issued":"1960-2010","summary":"The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, Tobias Smollett's last published novel and most celebrated work, appeared in June 1771, three months before the author's death. A classic in the history of the English novel, it takes the form of a collection of letters written by various members of Mr. Matthew Bramble's family (for whom Humphry Clinker is a general servant) during their eight months of travel in England and Scotland in the 1760s. The wanderings of the Bramble party result in a series of amusing adventures and episodes, unfolding within the main plot in which the eccentric and contentious characters--&quot;originals&quot; as Bramble's nephew calls them--discover the sources of true happiness.In this work, Smollett realized two long-standing artistic goals--a harmonious fusion of satire and comedy and, through the deliberate intertwining of historical and contrived details, a portrayal of the world as constructed from both fiction and fact. In achieving the latter, Smollett was aided by the novel's form, for the epistolary style of travel books in his day set a precedent for the extensive commentary on incidents, experiences, people, and places in Humphry Clinker and allowed him to relate the same stories through multiple points of view.Much of the continuing appeal of the novel can be traced to the gossipy insights found in its mass of historical, biographical, economic, political, social, geographical, and topographical details. One meets, for example, Smollett's version of such historical personages as William Pitt, James Quin, and the Duke of Newcastle, as well as fictionalized versions of Smollett's own friends and enemies. Even minor characters are often taken directly from history. In addition, the book includes numerous quotations from and allusions to the Bible, earlier and contemporary literature, the Book of Common Prayer, medical matter, and proverbial lore.This edition ofHumphry Clinkerincludes illustrations by George Cruikshank and Thomas Rowlandson and is the first scholarly edition to feature a comprehensive introduction, exhaustive textual editing, and detailed notes that cite passages from Smollett's nonfictional works and the works of his contemporaries to analyze the mass of allusions and references in the novel. Thomas R. Preston's introduction discusses the composition, publication, and early reception ofHumphry Clinker, the crucial importance of money in the narrative and its revelation of character, and Smollett's use of language and dialect.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780820312033","urn:ISBN:9780140430219","urn:ISBN:9780192835949","urn:ISBN:9780141441429","urn:ISBN:9781853262708","urn:ISBN:9780192816641","urn:ISBN:9780199538980","urn:ISBN:9780460019750","urn:ISBN:9781173108847"],"id":66146,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=0S9lQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10156/?feed=opds","author":"Tobias George Smollett","isOwn":false},{"category":[" Drama","Accessible book","Brothers","Brothers -- Drama","Comedies","Criticism and interpretation","Drama","English drama (Comedy)","English literature","English Young adult drama","Greece -- Drama","History and criticism","In library","Juvenile drama","Literature","Mistaken identity","Mistaken identity -- Drama","OverDrive","Plays","PR","Problems, exercises","Protected DAISY","Shipwreck survival","Shipwreck victims","Shipwreck victims -- Drama","Survival after airplane accidents, shipwrecks","Twins","Twins -- Drama"],"updated":"2016-08-23T16:33:02","language":"en","title":"The comedy of errors","issued":"1962-2011","summary":"A Comedy of Errors is Shakespeare's shortest play yet one of his most popular comedies.

Juliet Dusinberre demonstrates that Rosalind's authority in the play grows from new ideas about women and reveals that Shakespeare's heroine reinvents herself for every age. But the play is also deeply rooted in Elizabethan culture, and through it Shakespeare addresses some of the hotly debated issues of the period. Dusinberre's introduction begins with a brief analysis of the play to preface a vast and thorough exploration of characters, cultural context, sources, setting, staging, literary and legendary influences, themes of love, politics, and gender, and more. Images, illustrations, and a casting and doubling chart appear throughout the introduction and within the five appendices. The Arden Shakespearehas developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume. An introduction comprehensively contextualizes the play, chronicling the history and culture that surrounded and influenced Shakespeare at the time of its writing and performance, and closely surveying critical approaches to the work. Detailed appendices address problems like dating and casting, and analyze the differing Quarto and Folio sources. A full commentary by one or more of the play's foremost contemporary scholars illuminates the text, glossing unfamiliar terms and drawing from an abundance of research and expertise to explain allusions and significant background information. Highly informative and accessible, Arden offers the fullest experience of Shakespeare available to a reader.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140714715","urn:ISBN:9780743484862","urn:ISBN:9780451526786","urn:ISBN:9780140707144","urn:ISBN:9780671722562","urn:ISBN:9781904271222","urn:ISBN:9780192834195","urn:ISBN:9780451524607","urn:ISBN:9780553212907"],"id":66156,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=m1krqgLJkZAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10309/?feed=opds","author":"William Shakespeare","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Fiction","GITenberg","History","Murderers","Murderers -- Fiction","Murderers in fiction","PR","Protected DAISY","Psychological fiction","Scotland -- Fiction","Scotland in fiction","Social conditions"],"updated":"2016-08-23T16:52:46","language":"en","title":"The private memoirs and confessions of a justified sinner","issued":"1970-2011","summary":"One of the supreme masterpieces of Romantic fiction and Scottish literature,The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinneris a terrifying tale of murder and amorality, and of one man's descent into madness and despair. James Hogg's sardonic novel follows a young man who, falling under the spell of a mysterious stranger who bears an uncanny likeness to himself, embarks on a career as a serial murderer. The memoirs are presented by a narrator whose attempts to explain the story only succeed in intensifying its more baffling and bizarre aspects. Is the young man the victim of a psychotic delusion, or has he been tempted by the devil to wage war against God's enemies?

The novel takes place in St. Petersburg, Russia and Geneva, Switzerland and is viewed as Conrad's response to the themes explored in Crime and Punishment; Conrad being reputed to have detested Dostoevsky. It is also, some say, Conrad's response to his own early life; his father was a famous revolutionary imprisoned by the Russians, but, instead of following in his father's footsteps, at the age of sixteen Conrad left his native land forever. Indeed, while writing Under Western Eyes, Conrad suffered a weeks-long breakdown during which he conversed with the novel's characters in Polish.This novel is considered to be one of Conrad's major works and is close in subject matter to The Secret Agent. It is full of cynicism and conflict about the historical failures of revolutionary movements and ideals. Conrad remarks in this book, as well as others, on the irrationality of life, the opacity of character, and the unfairness with which suffering is inflicted upon the innocent and poor and the careless disregard for fellow life with whom we share existence.

It depicts the fall and rise of the Primrose family, presided over by the benevolent vicar, the narrator of a fairy-tale plot of impersonation and deception, the abduction of a beautiful heroine and the machinations of an aristocratic villain. By turns comic and sentimental, the novel's popularity owes much to its recognizable depiction of domestic life and loving family relationships. New to this edition is an introduction by Robert L. Mack that examines the reasons for the novels enduring popularity, as well as the critical debates over whether it is a straightforward novel of sentiment or a satire on the social and economic inequalities of the period and the very literary conventions and morality it seems to embody. This edition also includes a new, up-to-date bibliography and expanded notes, and contains reprints of Arthur Friedman's authoritative Oxford English Novels text of the corrected first edition of 1766.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140431599","urn:ISBN:9780192805126","urn:ISBN:9780199537549","urn:ISBN:9780192839404","urn:ISBN:9780192815606","urn:ISBN:9780486434100","urn:ISBN:9781853267475","urn:ISBN:9780245542701","urn:ISBN:9780451520449"],"id":66609,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=vrrLFWxjq6EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11412/?feed=opds","author":"Oliver Goldsmith","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Children","Children's accidents -- Juvenile fiction","Children's literature, English","Classic Literature","Family life","Family life -- Juvenile fiction","Fiction","Friendship","Friendship -- Juvenile fiction","GITenberg","Juvenile Fiction","New England -- Social life and customs -- Juvenile fiction","OverDrive","PS","PZ","Winter","Winter -- Juvenile fiction","Youth"],"updated":"2016-08-25T23:44:21","language":"en","title":"Jack and Jill","issued":"1928-2011","summary":"JACK AND JILL - 1890 - HARMONY VILLAGE. .

By her look and carriage she appeared to belong to that gentle order of society which has no worldly sorrow except when its jewellery gets stolen; but, as a fact not generally known, her claim to distinction was rather one of brains than of blood. She was the daughter of a gentleman who lived in a large house not his own, and began life as a baby christened Ethelberta after an infant of title who does not come into the story at all, having merely furnished Ethelberta's mother with a subject of contemplation. She became teacher in a school, was praised by examiners, admired by gentlemen, not admired by gentlewomen, was touched up with accomp-lishments by masters who were coaxed into painstaking by her many graces, and, entering a mansion as governess to the daughter thereof, was stealthily married by the son. He, a minor like herself, died from a chill caught during the wedding tour, and a few weeks later was followed into the grave by Sir Ralph Petherwin, his unforgiving father, who had bequeathed his wealth to his wife absolutely.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140435023","urn:ISBN:9780140435559","urn:ISBN:9780333177617","urn:ISBN:9780460876452","urn:ISBN:9780333417508","urn:ISBN:9780312357368","urn:ISBN:9781406523201","urn:ISBN:9780543893291","urn:ISBN:9780333334966"],"id":66677,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=y52cNrl0BvYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13696/?feed=opds","author":"Thomas Hardy","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Brothers and sisters","Brothers and sisters -- Juvenile fiction","Castles -- Juvenile fiction","Children's literature, English","England","Fantasy","Fantasy fiction, English","Fiction","Friendship","Friendship -- Juvenile fiction","Great Britain -- History -- Edward VII, 1901-1910 -- Juvenile fiction","History","In library","Juvenile Fiction","Magic","Magic -- Juvenile fiction","Protected DAISY","PZ","Rings","Rings -- Juvenile fiction","Wishes","Wishes -- Juvenile fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-15T11:21:41","language":"en","title":"The enchanted castle","issued":"1956-2011","summary":"The Enchanted Castle, written by legendary author E.

The Egyptian Queen Tera has been awakened, and is coming to take what she believes to be hers - whatever the cost to the Trelawny family. Set in London, Cornwall and Egypt, and written at a time when a fascination with the East pervaded Edwardian England, The Jewel of Seven Stars reflected the interest both in the Orient's perceived savagery and moral degradation, and in its exotic beauty and opulence. Kate Hebblethwaite's introduction explores the politics and history behind The Jewel of Seven Stars, and looks at the gender issues within late Victorian and Edwardian stories of the supernatural.

In it, the widowed American Adam Verver is in Europe with his daughter Maggie. They are rich, finely appreciative of European art and culture, and deeply attached to each other. Maggie has all the innocent charm of so many of Jamess young American heroines. She is engaged to Amerigo, an impoverished Italian prince; he must marry money, and as his name suggests, an American heiress is the perfect solution. The golden bowl, first seen in a London curio shop, is used emblematically throughout the novel. Not solid gold but gilded crystal, the perfect surface conceals a flaw; it is symbolic of the relationship between the main characters and of the world in which they move. Also in Europe is an old friend of Maggies, Charlotte Stant, a girl of great charm and independence, and Maggie is blindly ignorant of the fact that she and the prince are lovers. Maggie and Amerigo are married and have a son, but Maggie remains dependent for real intimacy on her father, and she and Amerigo grow increasingly apart. Feeling that her father has suffered a loss through her marriage, Maggie decides to find him a wife, and her choice falls on Charlotte. Charlottes affair with the prince continues and Adam Verver seems to her to be a suitable and convenient match. When Maggie herself finally comes into possession of the golden bowl, the flaw is revealed to her, and, inadvertently, the truth about Amerigo and Charlotte. Fanny Assingham (an older woman, aware of the truth from the beginning) deliberately breaks the bowl, and this marks the end of Maggies innocence. She is no pathetic heroine-victim, however. Abstaining from outcry and outrage she instead takes the reins and maneuvers people and events. She still wants to be with Amerigo, but he must continue to be worth having and they must all be saved further humiliations and indignities.

Leonard went away, more subdued in spirit than if he had been whipped. Sally lingered for a moment. She stopped to add: &quot;I think it's for them without sin to throw stones at a poor child, and cut up good laburnum branches to whip him. I only do as my betters do, when I call Leonard's mother Mrs. Denbigh.&quot; The moment she had said this she was sorry; it was an ungenerous advantage after the enemy had acknowledged himself defeated. Mr. Benson dropped his head upon his hands, and hid his face, and sighed deeply. -Chapter XIX: &quot;After Five Years&quot; As interest in 19th-century English literature by women has been reinvigorated by a resurgence in popularity of the works of Jane Austen, readers are rediscovering a writer whose fiction, once widely beloved, fell by the wayside. British novelist ELIZABETH CLEGHORN GASKELL (1810-1865)-whose books were sometimes initially credited to, simply, &quot;Mrs. Gaskell&quot;-is now recognized as having created some of the most complex and progressive depictions of women in the literature of the age, and is today justly celebrated for her precocious use of the regional dialect and slang of England's industrial North. Ruth-Gaskell's third novel, first published in three volumes in 1853-is notable as one of the rare instances in the fiction of the era of a positive portrayal of unwed motherhood and for its thematic condemnation of the social stigma of illegitimacy. The tale of a young woman seduced and abandoned by her lover, then taken in and protected by a kindly minister and his sister, it is remarkably progressive for the period. Friend and literary companion to the likes of Charles Dickens and Charlotte Bront-the latter of whom Gaskell wrote an acclaimed 1857 biography-Gaskell is today being restored to her rightful place alongside them. This charming replica volume is an excellent opportunity for 21st-century fans of British literature to embrace one of its most unjustly forgotten authors.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140434309","urn:ISBN:9780192834768","urn:ISBN:9780460876605","urn:ISBN:9780199581955","urn:ISBN:9781604594744","urn:ISBN:9781609420499","urn:ISBN:9781461044574","urn:ISBN:9780742623590","urn:ISBN:9781451570311"],"id":13888,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=vsT8OGxRI9cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15959/?feed=opds","author":"Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell","isOwn":false},{"category":["Children's literature, English","Dana, Richard Henry, 1815-1882","G","Literature","Nonfiction","Sailors","Seafaring life","Social conditions","Voyages and travels"],"updated":"2016-09-19T15:44:55","language":"en","title":"Two years before the mast","issued":"1981","summary":"A young man tells of his experiences as a common sailor and provides a realistic portrait of the brutal life of nineteenth-century seamen","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140390087"],"id":5536,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=5Hewh0c6twgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15962/?feed=opds","author":"Richard Henry Dana","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","BJ","Conduct of life","Ethics","GITenberg","In library","Protected DAISY"],"updated":"2016-09-19T16:08:16","language":"en","title":"An enquiry concerning the principles of morals","issued":"1957-2010","summary":"About Hume David Hume (1711-1776) is one of the greatest of philosophers. Today he probably ranks highest of all British philosophers in terms of influence and philosophical standing. His philosophical work ranges across morals, the mind, metaphysics, epistemology, and aesthetics; he had broad interests notonly in philosophy as it is now conceived but in history, politics, economics, religion, and the arts. He was a master of English prose. The Clarendon Hume Edition General Editors: Professor T. L. Beauchamp, Georgetown University, USA, Professor D. F. Norton, McGill University, Canada, and Professor M. A. Stewart, University of Lancaster, England The Clarendon Hume will include all of his works except his History of England and minor historical writings; it will be the only thorough critical edition, and will provide a far more extensive scholarly treatment than any previous editions. This edition (which has been in preparation since the1970s) offers authoritative annotation, bibliographical information, and indexes, and draws upon the major advances in textual scholarship that have been made since the publication of earlier editions--advances both in the understanding of editorial principle and practice and in knowledge of thehistory of Hume's own texts. The Edition will comprise: Volumes 1 and 2: A Treatise of Human Nature, edited by D. F. Norton Volume 3: An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, edited by T. L. Beauchamp Volume 4: An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, edited by T. L. Beauchamp Volume 5: The Natural History of Religion and the Dissertation on the Passions Volumes 6 and 7: Essays Volume 8: Dialogues concerning Natural Religion and other posthumous publications, edited by M. A. Stewart About this work An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals was Hume's third great philosophical work, first published in 1751. Hume's aim in this elegant and lucid work was to present in an accessible way his theory of the foundation of morality in human nature, which had developed significantly since hefirst addressed the subject in the Treatise of Human Nature (1739/40). He discusses moral psychology; freedom, necessity, and causation; practical reasoning; justice; virtues and other moral qualities. He considered this Enquiry to be 'of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary,incomparably the best'. About this volume The authoritative version of the text, based upon the 1772 edition that was seen through the press by Hume himself, is presented here accurately and clearly. The editor's introduction sets the work in its historical context; the annotation and glossary provide information about Hume's sources,allusions, citations, and meanings, to help readers towards a full understanding of the text. A biographical appendix identifies the many people mentioned by Hume in the Enquiry. Bibliographies list the works cited by Hume and a selection of the secondary literature. Hume's original index isreproduced, together with a new general index by the editor.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780198751854","urn:ISBN:9780915145454","urn:ISBN:9780198751847","urn:ISBN:9780875480183","urn:ISBN:9780672602368","urn:ISBN:9780023531309","urn:ISBN:9781419106323","urn:ISBN:9781406813661","urn:ISBN:9780915145461"],"id":66722,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=yDGqQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16082/?feed=opds","author":"David Hume","isOwn":false},{"category":["18th century","English Authors","Europe -- Fiction","Fiction","Gamblers -- Fiction","GITenberg","Humorous stories","Ireland -- Fiction","Irish -- Foreign countries -- Fiction","Literature","Military","Moral conditions","PR","Rogues and vagabonds -- Fiction","Satire","Social classes","Wealth"],"publishers":[{"publisher":"University of Michigan Press"}],"updated":"2016-09-19T19:13:11","language":"en","title":"Barry Lyndon","issued":"1970-2010","summary":"","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780472110421","urn:ISBN:9780140040067","urn:ISBN:9780192816672","urn:ISBN:9780199537464","urn:ISBN:9781406808469","urn:ISBN:9780448123639","urn:ISBN:9781456424619","urn:ISBN:9781406570489","urn:ISBN:9781437829549"],"id":99745,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=qw2mnyJcvjsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16775/?feed=opds","author":"William Makepeace Thackeray","isOwn":false},{"category":["Capitalists and financiers","Capitalists and financiers -- Fiction","Capitalists and financiers in fiction","Classic Literature","Commercial crimes","Commercial crimes -- Fiction","Commercial crimes in fiction","England in fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Literature","London (England) -- Fiction","Mate selection -- Fiction","OverDrive","PR","Protected DAISY","Satire","Social life and customs"],"updated":"2016-11-10T13:05:27","language":"en","title":"The way we live now","issued":"1874-2012","summary":"Widely acknowledged to be the masterpiece of Trollope's prolific Victorian career, &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot; is the scathing satire he wrote upon returning to England after traveling abroad. In seeking to discuss the deceit and dissipation he found, Trollope spared no iniquitous aspect he perceived in business, politics, social classes, literature, and various vice-related activities. The result of his efforts is an impressive array of characters, such as the old coquette Lady Carbury, her dissolute son Sir Felix, a spoiled and treacherously lovely heiress Marie, and her colossal figure of a father Augustus Melmotte, the great financier whose deceptive plots dupe countless wealthy individuals. Through the swindling, bribery, feuding, and shameless self-promotion of these characters, Trollope writes a sweeping panorama of vice for the sake of monetary greed that will cause readers to reflect on the morality of our own time.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780375757310","urn:ISBN:9780140433920","urn:ISBN:9781853262555","urn:ISBN:9780199537792","urn:ISBN:9781593083045","urn:ISBN:9780142437131","urn:ISBN:9780192835611","urn:ISBN:9780192815767","urn:ISBN:9781420933260"],"id":66875,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=1i7EQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/20633/?feed=opds","author":"Anthony Trollope","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adaptations","Children's literature, English","Classic Literature","Folklore","GITenberg","Juvenile literature","Nursery rhymes","Nursery rhymes -- Adaptations","OverDrive","PZ","Tales"],"updated":"2016-11-10T13:54:04","language":"en","title":"Mother Goose in prose","issued":"1986-2010","summary":"Frank Baum was a famous author of children's books.

Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes &amp; Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices &amp; Glossaries, when appropriate All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes &amp; Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. With Lord Jim, first published in 1900, Joseph Conrad transformed a tale of seafaring adventure into a subtle study of the meaning of honor and courage, loyalty and betrayal. When Jim, an idealistic merchant seaman and ship’s officer, abandons the supposedly sinking Patna and its passengers, he dashes his youthful dreams of glory in a single stroke. Condemned in court for his impetuous act of cowardice, Jim relegates himself to a life roaming the Far East. Unforgettably told by Marlow, who also narrates Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, the story of Lord Jim plumbs the mysteries of a man renounced by society but driven by a desire for redemption. A. Michael Matin is a professor in the English Department of Warren Wilson College in Asheville, North Carolina. He has published articles on various twentieth-century British and postcolonial writers, and has written the introduction and notes for the Barnes &amp; Noble Classics edition of Heart of Darkness and Selected Short Fiction by Joseph Conrad.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780460876650","urn:ISBN:9780521824354","urn:ISBN:9781853260377","urn:ISBN:9780140180923","urn:ISBN:9780141441610","urn:ISBN:9780192840677","urn:ISBN:9780199536023","urn:ISBN:9781551111728","urn:ISBN:9780141183541"],"id":66894,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=CS-5PQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/21885/?feed=opds","author":"Joseph Conrad","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Fiction","Historical fiction","In library","Japan in fiction","Protected DAISY"],"updated":"2013-12-26T14:09:16","language":"en","title":"Shiké","issued":"1981-1993","summary":"Shike is a novel about two characters: Jebu, a fighting monk of the Order of Zinja, and Taniko, the minor noblewoman with whom he falls in love on his first mission -- escorting her to an arranged marriage with a far older and extremely influential nobleman.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780006164487","urn:ISBN:9780515059441","urn:ISBN:9780515065879","urn:ISBN:9780515070880","urn:ISBN:9780515075182","urn:ISBN:9780861881642","urn:ISBN:9780515090819","urn:ISBN:9780515081534","urn:ISBN:9789100483814"],"id":128680,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/8c/f0/8cf031da8c7504a07858324f245258e3.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1042/?feed=opds","author":"Robert Shea","isOwn":false},{"category":["Feminist theory","gender","Literary Criticism","Nonfiction","Popular culture","Science fiction, American","Sexism","Sexual Behavior","Star trek (Television program)","Star Trek films","Women in fiction"],"updated":"2013-12-26T19:54:55","language":"en","title":"Drones, Clones, and Alpha Babes","issued":"2006","summary":"The Star Trek franchise represents one of the most successful emanations of popular media in our culture.

In Drones, Clones and Alpha Babes, Diana Relke sheds light on how the Star Trek narratives influence and are influenced by shifting cultural values in the United States, using these as portals to the sociopolitical and sociocultural landscapes of the United States, pre- and post-9/11.

In these affirmative practices, social relations and the creation of goods and knowledge are not driven by the desire for financial gain or professional status.

Peirce's theories of pragmatism as a basis for his own conception of that influential philosophy. For James, this meant an emphasis on &quot;radical empiricism&quot; and the concept that the meaning of any idea — philosophical, political, social, or otherwise — has validity only in terms of its experiential and practical consequences.<br />\r\nJames propounded his theories of pragmatism in this book, one of the most important in American philosophy. In a sense, he wished to test competing systems of thought in the &quot;marketplace of actual experience&quot; to determine their validity, i.e. whether adopting a particular philosophical theory or way of looking at the world makes an actual difference in individual conduct or in how we perceive and react to the varieties of experience. In these pages, James not only makes a strong case for his own ideas, but mounts a powerful attack against the transcendental and rationalist tradition.<br />\r\nFor anyone interested in William James or the history of American philosophical thought, Pragmatism is an essential and thought provoking reference. In this handy, inexpensive edition, it will challenge and stimulate any thinking person. </p>\r\n","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781473374799","urn:ISBN:9780674697355","urn:ISBN:9780486282701","urn:ISBN:9780915145058","urn:ISBN:9780760749968","urn:ISBN:9780879756338","urn:ISBN:9781463684419","urn:ISBN:9781595477972","urn:ISBN:9781482054415"],"id":193766,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=7cIZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/18440/?feed=opds","author":"William James","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Bibliography","Children's poetry, English","Collections","English Nonsense verses","English poetry","Fiction","GITenberg","History and criticism","Illustrations","Juvenile literature","Nonsense verses","Nonsense verses, English","Poetry","PR","Protected DAISY","Translations into French"],"updated":"2016-08-05T20:47:54","language":"en","title":"The Hunting of the Snark","issued":"1876-2011","summary":"He would answer to “Hi!” or to any loud cry, Such as “Fry me!” or “Fritter my wig!” To “What-you-may-call-um!” or “What-was-his name!” But especially “Thing-um-a-jig!” While, for those who preferred a more forcible word, He had different names from these: His intimate friends called him “Candle-ends,” And his enemies “Toasted-cheese.” “His form is ungainly his intellect small—— (So the Bellman would often remark) “But his courage is perfect! And that, after all, Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.” He would joke with hyenas, returning their stare With an impudent wag of the head: And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear, “Just to keep up its spirits,” he said. The Hunting of the Snark is Lewis Carroll’s epic nonsense poem, first published in 1876. Though Carroll’s peculiar wit and imagination are evident here, this work, unlike his earlier Alice books, is a much darker tale. Here, ten characters whose names begin with the letter B disappear, go mad, and find themselves struggling to navigate an impossible path through a nonsensical world. Throughout the poem there is a prevailing atmosphere of disorder and chaos, heightened by Carroll’s descriptions of grotesque creatures such as the Bandersnatch and the Jubjub bird and his characteristic use of invented words—such as uffish, beamish, and frumious. The meaning of the poem, and of the Snark itself, has been the subject of much debate, but nevertheless it remains a fun and lively read thanks to its combination of strangeness and whimsy. This new facsimile edition of the 1876 riginal is richly bound in red cloth with gold embossing and features reproductions of the original illustrations by Henry Holiday. This edition of the The Hunting of the Snark will be a treasured gift and collector’s item for fanciful readers of all ages.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780886802738","urn:ISBN:9780140434910","urn:ISBN:9780413743800","urn:ISBN:9780850671018","urn:ISBN:9780712358132","urn:ISBN:9780701106058","urn:ISBN:9781935554240","urn:ISBN:9781854379566","urn:ISBN:9781605971469"],"id":62460,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=jYg0PWYg-vgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4865/?feed=opds","author":"Lewis Carroll","isOwn":false},{"category":["BX","Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- Sacred books","GITenberg","History","Mormon Church -- Sacred books","Mormons","Nonfiction","OverDrive","Philosophy","Religion","Religion & Spirituality"],"updated":"2016-08-05T20:50:09","language":"en","title":"Book of Mormon","issued":"1830-2011","summary":"Regarded as sacred scripture by millions, the Book of Mormon -- first published in 1830 -- is one of the most significant documents in American religious history. This new reader-friendly version reformats the complete, unchanged 1920 text in the manner of modern translations of the Bible, with paragraphs, quotations marks, poetic forms, topical headings, multichapter headings, indention of quoted documents, italicized reworkings of biblical prophecies, and minimized verse numbers. It also features a hypothetical map based on internal references, an essay on Book of Mormon poetry, a full glossary of names, genealogical charts, a basic bibliography of Mormon and non-Mormon scholarship, a chronology of the translation, eyewitness accounts of the gold plates, and information regarding the lost 116 pages and significant changes in the text.The Book of Mormon claims to be the product of three historical interactions: the writings of the original ancient American authors, the editing of the fourth-century prophet Mormon, and the translation of Joseph Smith. The editorial aids and footnotes in this edition integrate all three perspectives and provide readers with a clear guide through this complicated text. New readers will find the story accessible and intelligible; Mormons will gain fresh insights from familiar verses seen in a broader narrative context. This is the first time the Book of Mormon has been published with quotation marks, select variant readings, and the testimonies of women involved in the translation process. It is also the first return to a paragraphed format since versification was added in 1879.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781591562849","urn:ISBN:9781592975013","urn:ISBN:9780385513166","urn:ISBN:9780976402510","urn:ISBN:9780967686554","urn:ISBN:9781592975006","urn:ISBN:9780385519472","urn:ISBN:9780143105534","urn:ISBN:9780252073410"],"id":62477,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=bjsVAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4877/?feed=opds","author":"Covenant","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Black humor","Classic Literature","Fiction","GITenberg","In library","Literature","OverDrive","Protected DAISY","PS","Utopian Fiction","Utopias","Utopias -- Fiction","Women","Women -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-05T21:40:20","language":"en","title":"Herland","issued":"1979-2011","summary":"Herland tells the story of three American male explorers who, on the eve of World War II, stumble onto an all-female society somewhere in the distant reaches of the earth.

As fascinating to women for what it omits entirely as for what it discovers and invents for us, it is a fast and invigorating read. Charlotte Perkins Gilman was arguably the most important American author of the women's movement in the early 20th-century.

BOOK III. Satan, in a speech of much flalteriug commendation, endeavours to awaken in Jesus a passion for glory, by particularizing various instances of conquests achieved, and great actions performed, by persons at an early period of life. Our Lord replies, by showing the vanity of worldly fame, and the improper means by which it is generally attained; and contrasts with it the true glory of religious patience and virtuous wisdom, as exemplified in the character of Job. Satan justifies the love of glory from the example of God himself, who requires it from all hia creatures. Jesus detects the fallacy of this argnment, by showing that, as goodness is the true ground on which glory is due to the great Creator of ail things, sinful man can have no right whatever to it. Satan then urges our Lord respecting his claim to the throne of David: he tells him that the kingdom of Judea, being at that time a province of Rome, cannot be got possession of without much personal exertion on hia part, and presses him to lose no time in beginning to reign. Jesus refers him to the time allotted for this, as fur all other things; and, after intimating somewhat respecting his own previous sufferings, asks Satan, why he should be so solicitous for the exaltation of one, whose rising was destined to be hia fall. Satan replies, that his own desperate state, by excluding all hope, leaves little room for fear; and that, as his own punishment was equally doomed, he is not interested in preventing the reign of one, from whose apparent benevolence he might rather hope for some interference in his favour. Satan still pursues his former Incitements; and, supposing that the seeming reluctance of Jesus to be thus advanced might arise from his being unacquainted with the world and its glo...","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781434604903","urn:ISBN:9781458838513","urn:ISBN:9781449595487","urn:ISBN:9781603120272","urn:ISBN:9781420927023","urn:ISBN:9780543904409","urn:ISBN:9781598181678","urn:ISBN:9781604442328","urn:ISBN:9780768425604"],"id":62601,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=7XMNBGf4ClUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4958/?feed=opds","author":"JOHN MILTON","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Adventure and adventurers","Adventure stories","Blakeney, Percy, Sir (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","British","British -- France -- Fiction","Children's literature, English","Classic Literature","English language","Fiction","France -- History -- Revolution, 1789-1799 -- Fiction","GITenberg","Historical fiction","History","In library","Juvenile Fiction","Large type books","Nobility","Nobility -- Fiction","OverDrive","PR","Protected DAISY","Refugees","Sir Blakeney, Percy (Fictitious character)","Text-books for foreigners"],"updated":"2016-08-05T21:53:17","language":"en","title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel (Dodo Press)","issued":"1913-2011","summary":"When Baroness Emmuska Orczy wrote The Scarlet Pimpernel (1905), little did she know she was creating the super hero genre.

A master of clever disguises, stealth and elegant escapes -- skills that he uses to rescue doomed French aristocrats from the guillotine during the French Revolution's Reign of Terror. His signature -- a tiny scarlet flower.

Burroughs soon took up writing full-time and by the time the run of Under the Moons of Mars had finished he had completed two novels, including Tarzan of the Apes, which was published from October 1912 and went on to become his most successful brand. Burroughs also wrote popular science fiction/fantasy stories involving earthly adventurers transported to various planets, lost islands, and into the interior of the hollow earth in his Pellucidar stories (1915), as well as westerns and historical romances. Along with All-Story, many of his stories were published in the Argosy Magazine. Among his most famous works are: A Princess of Mars (1912), The Return of Tarzan (1913), The Gods of Mars (1913), The Warlord of Mars (1913-14), The Beasts of Tarzan (1914), At the Earth's Core (1914) and The Land that Time Forgot (1918).","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781576462379","urn:ISBN:9780345294784","urn:ISBN:9780345027061","urn:ISBN:9780345241641","urn:ISBN:9780345344137","urn:ISBN:9780345272782","urn:ISBN:9781576466469","urn:ISBN:9781596055223","urn:ISBN:9781595402172"],"id":62622,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=ezucPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4591/?feed=opds","author":"Edgar Rice Burroughs","isOwn":false},{"category":[" 20th century","Accessible book","Bildungsromans","British","British -- South America -- Fiction","Classic Literature","Fiction","GITenberg","In library","Literature","Love stories","Man-woman relationships","Ocean travel","Ocean travel -- Fiction","OverDrive","PR","Protected DAISY","Social conditions","Travel","Women","Women travelers","Women travelers -- Fiction","Young women","Young women -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-05T22:37:24","language":"en","title":"The voyage out","issued":"1915-2011","summary":" This is an OCR edition with typos.

As soon as breakfast was done, Willoughby disappeared over the vessel's side, carrying a brown leather case, shoutitfg over his shoulder that every one was to mind and behave themselves, for he would be kept in Lisbon doing business until five o'clock that afternoon. At about that hour he reappeared, carrying his case, professing himself tired, bothered, hungry, thirsty, cold, and in immediate need of his tea. Rubbing his hands, he told them the adventures of the day: how he had come upon poor old Jackson combing his moustache before the glass in the office, little expecting his descent, had put him through such a morning's wprk as seldom came his way; thn treated him to a lunch of champagne and ortolans; paid a call upon Mrs. f Jackson, who was fatter than ever, poor woman, but asked kindly after Rachel?and O Lord, little Jackson had confessed to a confounded piece of weakness?-wel1, well, no harm was done, he supposed, but what was the use of his giving orders if they were promptly disobeyed? He had said distinctly that he would take no passengers on this trip. Here he began searching in his pockets and eventually discovered a card, which he planked down on the table before Rachel.

Jude Fawley, poor and working-class, longs to study at the University of Christminster, but his ambitions to go to university are thwarted by class prejudice and his entrapment in a loveless marriage. He falls in love with his unconventional cousin, Sue Bridehead, and their refusal to marry when free to do so confirms their rejection of and by the world around them. The shocking fate that overtakes them is an indictment of a rigid and uncaring society. This is the first truly critical edition, taking account of the changes that Hardy made over twenty-five years. Hardy's last, and most controversial novel, this revised edition has the first truly critical text, a new chronology and bibliography, and substantially revised notes. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

They told tales of vice and intrigue that purported to be &quot;based on fact&quot; and also advocated the need for better female education that would prepare young women against sweet-talking seducers. Extremely popular in America after the Revolution and throughout the nineteenth century, Charlotte Temple and The Coquette were two of the most successful novels of the period. Reprinted here in their entirety, with Introductions by the literary scholar Cathy N. Davidson, they offer the modern student a glimpse at the earliest American popular fiction. Charlotte Temple, the most popular novel in America until Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, went through over 200 editions. It tells of a beautiful English girl who at the age of 15 is courted by and runs away with a British lieutenant named Montraville. Susanna Rowson, the daughter of a British naval officer, was one of the most accomplished women of the early national period. Actress, song-writer, novelist, poet, dramatist, and essayist, she was also the founder of one of the most progressive academies for young women of her day. She remained best-known, however, for Charlotte Temple, a novel that promised to be &quot;of service to [the]...young and unprotected woman in her first entrance into life.&quot; In her Introduction, Cathy Davidson discusses the enormous popularity of the book and the life of Susanna Rowson, which was even more sensational than those of the characters depicted in the novel.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780812971217","urn:ISBN:9780195042382","urn:ISBN:9780808400738","urn:ISBN:9781604506464","urn:ISBN:9781428018129","urn:ISBN:9780808400721","urn:ISBN:9781426465321","urn:ISBN:9781435318120","urn:ISBN:9781409796602"],"id":62655,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=jZs9tj2-yzYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5078/?feed=opds","author":"Mrs. Rowson","isOwn":false},{"category":[" 20th century","Accessible book","Booksellers and bookselling","Booksellers and bookselling -- Fiction","Brooklyn (New York, N.Y.) -- Fiction","Classic Literature","Fiction","GITenberg","In library","Mystery and detective stories","OverDrive","Protected DAISY","PS"],"updated":"2016-08-05T22:48:13","language":"en","title":"The Haunted Bookshop","issued":"1983-2010","summary":"Christopher Morley (1890-1957) was an American journalist, novelist, essayist and poet.

These changes condemn him to a life of poverty and disdain by most who know him. The story is related by an aspiring writer who never seems to be able to quite get the painter to admit he is either remorseful of all the human wreckage he's left in his wake, or so uncomfortable in this new life that he's sorry for having made such a hash of his it. &quot;Moon and Sixpence&quot; raises several interesting questions: Who makes the social contract anyway, and did Strickland knowingly sign on, or was he simply incorporated into it by society? Would it have been acceptable for Strickland to abandon his family to become a priest, missionary, or some other more acceptable form of profession? While the book is loosely based on the life of Paul Gaugin, it is really more about W. Somerset Maugham and his search for beauty and truth. Maugham shows us that while the search may be noble, the journey is not necessarily beautiful to everyone, especially those not involved. &quot;Moon and Sixpence&quot; is a must-read for anyone contemplating a life in the arts. While Strickland is a thoroughly dislikable character, he is one without artifice, totally lacking the ability to say anything other than what is true to him. He is a man consumed by his passion, completely lacking the need for approval. Maugham as usual creates a work that is both powerful and thought-provoking. &quot;Moon and Sixpence&quot; satisfys on at least two levels; as an excellent story, and as a philosophical treatise on art, beauty and passion.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780330241113","urn:ISBN:9780140185973","urn:ISBN:9780099284765","urn:ISBN:9780140004687","urn:ISBN:9781453692943","urn:ISBN:9780375724565","urn:ISBN:9780143039341","urn:ISBN:9780486287317","urn:ISBN:9780749303433"],"id":64190,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=u-lfm20GLjEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5171/?feed=opds","author":"William Somerset Maugham","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Classic Literature","Didactic fiction","Elopement","Elopement -- Fiction","Elopement in fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Literature","OverDrive","PR","Separation (Psychology)","Separation (Psychology) -- Fiction","Triangles (Interpersonal relations)","Triangles (Interpersonal relations) -- Fiction","Wessex (England) -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-05T23:09:09","language":"en","title":"A pair of blue eyes","issued":"1975-2009","summary":"Elfride Swancourt is the daughter of the Rector of Endelstow, a remote sea-swept parish in Corwall based on St Juliot, where Hardy began A Pair of Blue Eyes during the beginning of his courtship of his first wife, Emma. Blue-eyed and high-spirited, Elfride has little experience of the world beyond, and becomes entangled with two men: the boyish architect, Stephen Smith, and the older literary man, Henry Knight. The former friends become rivals, and Elfride faces an agonizing choice. Written at a crucial time in Hardy's life, A Pair of Blue Eyes expresses more directly than any of his novels the events and social forces that made him the writer he was. Elfride's dilemma mirrors the difficult decision Hardy himself had to make with this novel: to pursue the profession of architecture, where he was established, or literature, where he had yet to make his name.

Though no longer a household name, his works (particularly his fairy tales and fantasy novels) have inspired deep admiration in such notables as W. H. Auden, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Madeleine L'Engle. C. S. Lewis wrote that he regarded MacDonald as his &quot;master.&quot; Even Mark Twain, who initially despised MacDonald, became friends with him. MacDonald grew up influenced by his Congregational Church, with an atmosphere of Calvinism. But MacDonald never felt comfortable with some aspects of Calvinist doctrine. Later novels, such as Robert Falconer (1868) and Lilith (1895), show a distaste for the Calvinist idea that God's electing love is limited to some and denied to others. Especially in his Unspoken Sermons (1867-89) he shows a highly developed theology. His best-known works are Phantastes (1858), At the Back of the North Wind (1871) and The Princess and the Goblin (1872), all fantasy novels, and fairy tales such as - The Light Princess (1867), The Golden Key (1867), and The Wise Woman (1875). At the Back of the North Wind is a children's book by George MacDonald, published in 1871. It is a fantasy centered around a boy named Diamond and his adventures with the North Wind. Diamond travels together with the mysterious Lady North Wind through the nights.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781582870151","urn:ISBN:9781593106812","urn:ISBN:9780375413353","urn:ISBN:9780816704705","urn:ISBN:9780812567120","urn:ISBN:9780688078089","urn:ISBN:9781853261497","urn:ISBN:9780140350302","urn:ISBN:9780140367683"],"id":64192,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=A21EPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5159/?feed=opds","author":"George MacDonald","isOwn":false},{"category":["Children's literature, English","Fantasy fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-05T23:16:38","language":"en","title":"Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair","issued":"1977-2010","summary":"William Morris (1834-1896) was an English artist, writer, socialist and activist.

Morris and his friends formed an artistic movement, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.

Excerpt from book: A HOLIDAY THE masterful wind was up and out, shouting and chasing, the lord of the morning. Poplars swayed and tossed with a roaring swish; dead leaves sprang aloft, and whirled into space; and all the clear-swept heaven seemed to thrill with sound like a great harp. It was one of the first awakenings of the year. The earth stretched herself, smiling in her sleep; and everything leapt and pulsed to the stir of the giant's movement. With us it was a whole holiday; the occasion a birthday ? it matters not whose. Some one of us had had presents, and pretty conventional speeches, and had glowed with that sense of heroism which is no less sweet that nothing has been done to deserve it. But the holiday was for all, the rapture of awakening Nature for all, the various outdoor joys of puddles and sun and hedge breaking for all. Colt-like I ran through the meadows, frisking happy heels in the face of Nature laughing responsive. Above, the sky was bluest of the blue; wide pools left by the winter's floods flashed the colour back, true and brilliant; and the soft air thrilled with the germinating touch that seems to kindle something in my own small person as well as in the rash primrose already lurking in sheltered haunts. Out into the brimming sun-bathed world I sped, free of lessons, free of discipline and correction, for one day at least. My legs ran of themselves, and though I heard my name called faint and shrill behind, there was no stopping for me. It was only Harold, I concluded, and his legs, though shorter than mine, were good for a longer spurt than this. Then I heard it called again, but this time more faintly, with a pathetic break in the middle; and I pulled up short, recognising Charlotte's plaintive note. She panted up anon, and dropped on the turf beside me.

Three Men in a Boat begins: THERE were four of us -- George, and William Samuel Harris, and myself, and Montmorency. We were sitting in my room, smoking, and talking about how bad we were -- bad from a medical point of view I mean, of course. We were all feeling seedy, and we were getting quite nervous about it. Harris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness come over him at times, that he hardly knew what he was doing; and then George said that HE had fits of giddiness too, and hardly knew what HE was doing. With me, it was my liver that was out of order. I knew it was my liver that was out of order, because I had just been reading a patent liver-pill circular, in which were detailed the various symptoms by which a man could tell when his liver was out of order. I had them all. It is a most extraordinary thing, but I never read a patent medicine advertisement without being impelled to the conclusion that I am suffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most virulent form. The diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly with all the sensations that I have ever felt.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780194216548","urn:ISBN:9780140012132","urn:ISBN:9780486451107","urn:ISBN:9780765341617","urn:ISBN:9780141441214","urn:ISBN:9781420925623","urn:ISBN:9780140282603","urn:ISBN:9781453875209","urn:ISBN:9781404336292"],"id":64366,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=JcJOSwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5393/?feed=opds","author":"Jerome Klapka Jerome","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Authors, Scottish -- 19th century -- Biography","Biography","Children's literature, English","Fiction","GITenberg","Nonfiction","PR","Scotland -- Social life and customs -- 19th century","Scottish Authors","Social conditions","Social life and customs","Stevenson, Robert Louis, 1850-1894"],"updated":"2016-08-06T01:50:45","language":"en","title":"Memories and Portraits","issued":"1990-2002","summary":"Originally published in 1887, this is an excellent collection of short stories; memories of youth and childhood portraits of those who the writer had much loved but lost.Unintentionally autobiographical, it gives us an amazing insight into Stevenson's personality and the development of his character.

He is best known for his influential supernatural, fantasy, and horror fiction. He also is well known for his leading role in creating the legend of the Angels of Mons. At the age of eleven, he boarded at Hereford Cathedral School, where he received an excellent classical education. Family poverty ruled out attendance at university. Around 1890 Machen began to publish in literary magazines, writing stories influenced by the works of Robert Louis Stevenson, some of which used gothic or fantastic themes. This led to his first major success, The Great God Pan (1894), which was part of the growing aesthetic movement of the time. Machen's story was widely denounced for its sexual and horrific content and subsequently sold well, going into a second edition. Machen next produced The Three Impostors, a novel composed of a number of interwoven tales, in 1895. The novel and the stories within it were eventually to be regarded as among Machen's best works.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781406545531","urn:ISBN:9781871592115","urn:ISBN:9781906998165","urn:ISBN:9780809544608","urn:ISBN:9780836936285","urn:ISBN:9781466347489","urn:ISBN:9781407623481","urn:ISBN:9781438287768","urn:ISBN:9781587155970"],"id":64644,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=aoqkGAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5462/?feed=opds","author":"Arthur Machen","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adventure stories","Bildungsromans","Castaways","Castaways -- Fiction","Cousins -- Fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Islands -- Fiction","Love stories","PR","Shipwrecks","Shipwrecks -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T01:57:46","language":"en","title":"The Blue Lagoon","issued":"1974-2010","summary":"&quot;Early in 1907 one night, lying awake and pondering on the extraordinary world we live in, the idea came to me of what it must have been like to the cave men who had no language and for whom a sunset had no name tacked on to it, a storm no name, life no name, death no name and birth no name, and the idea came to me of two children, knowing nothing about any of these things, Čnding themselves alone on a desert island facing these nameless wonders.&quot; Thus Henry de Vere Stacpoole described the inspiration for his runaway bestseller of 1908, &quot;The Blue Lagoon.&quot; Arthur Lestrange embarks on a sea voyage for his health, taking with him his young son Richard and niece Emmeline. But when the ship catches fire and its passengers flee in lifeboats, the family becomes separated, and the two children wash ashore on an uninhabited island in the South Pacific. Accompanied only by an old Irish sailor, Dick and Em must learn to adapt and survive in their new home. But the idyllic beauty of their tropical island belies the danger that surrounds them as they come to terms with forces they cannot understand: life, death, and their growing love for one another. A huge success on both sides of the Atlantic when first published, Stacpoole's romance returns to print in this first-ever scholarly edition by Adrienne E. Gavin. This edition features an introduction, notes, and a chronology of Stacpoole's life and career, as well as the unabridged text of the first edition and a cover illustration by Willy Pogany from the rare 1910 edition. As Professor Gavin notes in her introduction, Stacpoole's tale of escape from the pressures of modern life and return to a simple life close to nature has lost none of its appeal in the century since its publication; in fact, it may be more relevant today than ever.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781404300392","urn:ISBN:9781934555729","urn:ISBN:9781406505535","urn:ISBN:9781440095269","urn:ISBN:9781438509754","urn:ISBN:9780708819852","urn:ISBN:9781117516431","urn:ISBN:9788132002451","urn:ISBN:9788132027911"],"id":64645,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=V4SDPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5474/?feed=opds","author":"H.

They stood him near his mother's bedroom window and did what they would to him. During the earlier anguishes of the process he was mute, exceeding the pathos of the stricken calf in the shambles; but a student of eyes might have perceived in his soul the premonitory symptoms of a sinister uprising. At a rehearsal (in citizens' clothes) attended by mothers and grown-up sisters, Mrs. Lora lewbush had announced that she wished the costurning to be &quot;as medieval and artistic as possible.&quot; Otherwise, and as to details, she said, she would leave the costumes entirely to the good taste of the children's parents. Mrs. Schofield and Margaret were no archaeologists, but they knew that their taste was as good as that of other mothers and sisters concerned; so with perfect confidence they had planned and executed a costume for Penrod; and the only misgiving they felt was connected with the tractability of the Child Sir Lancelot himself. Stripped to his underwear, he had been made to wash himself vehemently; then they began by shrouding his legs in a pair of silk stockings, once blue but now mostly whitish. Upon Penrod they visibly surpassed mere ampleness; but they were long, and it required only a rather loose imagination to assume that they were tights. The upper part of his body was next concealed from viow by a garment so peculiar that its description becomes difficult. In 1886, Mrs. Schofield, then unmarried, had worn at her &quot;coming-out party&quot; a dress of vivid salmon silk which had been remodelled after her marriage to accord with various epochs of fashion until a final, unskilful campaign at a dye-house had left it in a condition certain...","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781404324442","urn:ISBN:9780253203618","urn:ISBN:9781421896168","urn:ISBN:9780385074414","urn:ISBN:9780143104858","urn:ISBN:9781603122085","urn:ISBN:9781171729211","urn:ISBN:9781847025890","urn:ISBN:9781458840370"],"id":64649,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=-GQhPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5507/?feed=opds","author":"Booth Tarkington","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adventure and adventurers -- Fiction","GITenberg","Historical fiction","Kidnapping -- Fiction","PR","PZ","Scotland -- History -- 18th century -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-07-27T14:00:04","language":"en","title":"Kidnapped","issued":"1887-2011","summary":"","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781619491816","urn:ISBN:9780004216362","urn:ISBN:9780883011324","urn:ISBN:9780893754136","urn:ISBN:9780439295789","urn:ISBN:9780140434019","urn:ISBN:9780141441795","urn:ISBN:9781416534747","urn:ISBN:9780553212600"],"id":98529,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=Kx0cQAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4519/?feed=opds","author":"Robert Louis Stevenson","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Adoption -- Juvenile fiction","Boys -- Juvenile fiction","Children's literature, English","Classic Literature","Fiction","GITenberg","Identity (Philosophical concept) -- Juvenile fiction","Mountain life -- Juvenile fiction","Orphans -- Juvenile fiction","OverDrive","PS","PZ","United States -- Juvenile fiction","Violinists -- Juvenile fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T02:21:40","language":"en","title":"Just David","issued":"1998-2011","summary":"Far up on the mountain-side stood alone in the clearing.

The author spent part of her childhood in rural Maine, where Kate Douglas Wiggin sets the book. The optimistic and spirited main character, Rebecca Rowena Randall is sent to live with her two strict and dour aunts in the fictional town of Riverboro, Maine. Though she is, according to her aunts, more like her shiftless father than her accomplished mother, Rebecca's joy of life, in the end, inspires them. The enormously popular story was adapted for a Broadway play in 1907, and was made into several films, including a 1938 version starring Shirley Temple. Wiggin spent her life dedicated to children's welfare. She headed the first free kindergarten in California, in the slums of San Francisco, and established a kindergarten teachers' training school with her sister. Her writing career, which began as a means of raising money for her school, spanned four decades. After the death of her first husband in 1889, she relocated back to Maine, where her summer home in Hollis is now the home to the town's Salmon Falls Library.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140367591","urn:ISBN:9781853261343","urn:ISBN:9780440475330","urn:ISBN:9780694015283","urn:ISBN:9780893754990","urn:ISBN:9780590413435","urn:ISBN:9780688134815","urn:ISBN:9781407629506","urn:ISBN:9780618346943"],"id":64657,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=YNKN8dhXBUgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5774/?feed=opds","author":"Kate Douglas Wiggin","isOwn":false},{"category":["California -- Description and travel","Calistoga (Calif.) -- Description and travel","Description and travel","Ethnic groups","F850.5","Fiction","GITenberg","Mines and mineral resources","Napa Valley (Calif.) -- Description and travel","Stevenson, Robert Louis, 1850-1894 -- Travel -- California","Travel","Zamorano 80"],"updated":"2016-08-06T17:22:05","language":"en","title":"The Silverado squatters","issued":"1984-2010","summary":"Just as Peter Mayle captured the mood an characters of Provence, Robert Louis Stevenson evokes California's wine country and some of the unique characters he found there while honeymooning with Bay Area native Frances Osbourne and her stepson in the summer of 1880.

The author's first work published on this side of the Atlantic (with the exception of a few poems in The Atlantic Monthly), The Silverado Squatters laid the groundwork for the immense popularity Stevenson came to enjoy here.

Hidden behind towering, impassable cliffs, Caspak will not easily give up its secrets. Unique and terrible animals and peoples inhabit the island. Dinosaurs terrorize tropical jungles to the south, while menacing winged humanoids dwell in cities on a large island in the north. Caught between these threats are scattered groups of human beings. Despite their differences, however, Caspak's animals and peoples are all connected in a mysterious and marvelous way. This commemorative edition features the entire Caspak trilogy in one volume, as intended by the author. In his introduction, Mike Resnick celebrates Edgar Rice Burroughs and the timeless appeal of this story. Also included are Scott Tracy Griffin's glossary of terms from the Caspakian language, a rare map of Caspak drawn by Burroughs, and the classic J.

They pulled and hauled upon me, and some of them struck me; but for the most part they were not inclined to brutality. It was only the hairier ones, who most closely resembled the Sto-lu, who maltreated me. At last my captors led me into a great cave in the mouth of which a fire was burning. The floor was littered with filth, including the bones of many animals, and the atmosphere reeked with the stench of human bodies and putrefying flesh. Here they fed me, releasing my arms, and I ate of half-cooked aurochs steak and a stew, which may have been made of snakes, for many of the long, round pieces of meat suggested them most nauseatingly. ~~~ Edgar Rice Burroughs created one of the most iconic figures in American pop culture, Tarzan of the Apes, and it is impossible to overstate his influence on entire genres of popular literature in the decades after his enormously winning pulp novels stormed the public's imagination. The People That Time Forgot, first published in book form in 1924 as the sequel to The Land That Time Forgot, is one of Burrough's most thrilling science-fiction adventure stories. Here, modern man Thomas Billings travels to the lost continent of Caspak, near Antarctica, where, in a sheltered tropic jungle, dinosaurs still roam and savage proto-men maintain a strange civilization. Can Billings survive unknown dangers long enough to rescue the missing friend he came in search of? American novelist EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS (1875-1950) wrote dozens of adventure, crime, and science fiction novels that are still beloved today, including Tarzan of the Apes (1912), At the Earth's Core (1914), A Princess of Mars (1917), The Land That Time Forgot (1924), and Pirates of Venus (1934). He is reputed to have been reading a comic book when he died.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780345374035","urn:ISBN:9780426148326","urn:ISBN:9781596054967","urn:ISBN:9780441659470","urn:ISBN:9781576462317","urn:ISBN:9789380028392","urn:ISBN:9781600963483","urn:ISBN:9781406557695","urn:ISBN:9781404324572"],"id":64798,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=LOdSPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5924/?feed=opds","author":"Edgar Rice Burroughs","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adventure stories","Classic Literature","Core","Earth","Earth (Planet) -- Core -- Fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","OverDrive","PS","Science Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T18:25:02","language":"en","title":"Pellucidar","issued":"1915-2011","summary":"David Innes and his captive, a member of the reptilian Mahar master race of the interior world of Pellucidar, return from the surface world in the Iron Mole invented by his friend and companion in adventure Abner Perry.Emerging in Pellucidar at an unknown location, David frees his captive.

But there is an old prophecy which warns against such moves, and on the day of the wedding a gigantic iron helmet falls over Manfred's son's head. This monstrous mishap is only the beginning of this funnily creepy tale. But the plot, though wild and entertaining, is the least important thing about this 1764's novel. The really attractive, entertaining and literarily important thing is the creation of stereotypes: the foul weather; an ancient, dark castle full of closed halls, secret passages, corridors and doors; frightening apparitions; wicked tyrants desperate for fertile women; virtuous and pure ladies; heroic lads; dark and cold forests where ghosts appear, etc. Horace Walpole, who seems to have been an interesting man, must have had enormous fun writing this tone-setting book, which has had plenty of children in literature. Though imperfect in literary terms, &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; is well worth reading if for no other reason than to discover where many of the commonplaces in Gothic literature come from. The characters in &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; are more like &quot;types&quot; than living human beings. That said, the book is a breezy example of an early novel, before the Victorians got hold of the form and made the books longer and more &quot;respectable.&quot; Author Horace Walpole was the son of the prominent 18th century politician Robert Walpole, who is satirized in John Gay's &quot;The Beggar's Opera&quot; and in a number of works written by Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope. Perhaps fortunately, Robert Walpole passed away before Horace wrote this book!","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780192823519","urn:ISBN:9780199537211","urn:ISBN:9780140437676","urn:ISBN:9780486434124","urn:ISBN:9780192816061","urn:ISBN:9780020552000","urn:ISBN:9780760763070","urn:ISBN:9780030119507","urn:ISBN:9780850671032"],"id":65208,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=rd0dAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6293/?feed=opds","author":"Horace Walpole","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Benn Pitman","Conduct of life -- Juvenile fiction","Didactic fiction","Fairy tales","Fiction","GITenberg","PR","PZ","Short stories","Shorthand","Texts"],"updated":"2016-08-06T19:27:18","language":"en","title":"The King of the Golden River","issued":"1926-2011","summary":"John Ruskin (1819-1900) is best known for his work as an art critic and social critic, but is remembered as an author, poet and artist as well. Ruskin's essays on art and architecture were extremely influential in the Victorian and Edwardian eras. Ruskin's range was vast. He wrote over 250 works which started from art history, but expanded to cover topics ranging over science, geology, ornithology, literary criticism, the environmental effects of pollution, and mythology. In 1848, he married Effie Gray, for whom he wrote the early fantasy novel The King of the Golden River. After his death Ruskin's works were collected together in a massive &quot;library edition,&quot; completed in 1912 by his friends Edward Cook and Alexander Wedderburn. Its index is famously elaborate, attempting to articulate the complex interconnectedness of his thought.

Near the end of the nineteenth century, Graham falls into an ageless trance. He awakens at the dawn of the twenty-second century. A Council rules the world. They began simply as trustees of a large financial estate, but their snowballing wealth and power, over the course of two centuries, rendered government by the people impotent, irrelevant, and ultimately extinct. But who owns this wealth? Graham finds, to his shock, that he does. The men who first took responsibility for him in his trance left him their fortunes, and he is now the master of the world! But real power is only his if he can claim it. The Council controls the lives of the people, literally from cradle to grave. They keep the laboring classes trapped in an perpetual cycle of drudgery and dependence. They keep the upper classes satiated with entertainment and the Pleasure Cities. Not happy to have Graham conscious and potentially able to take this power into his own hands, the Council seeks to keep him isolated and ignorant. And a rebel group aims to capture him as a figurehead for their revolution, using the people's veneration of the Sleeper as a savior to seize the Council's power for their own. But when Graham, a democrat and liberal in his own time, learns the truth about the future world, he seeks to exercise his power for the people. To truly be master of the world, Graham must first master his fate-become a leader of people, and defeat those who would sooner kill them than see them free. Timeless as its protagonist, WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES is a tale from a century ago about a century hence that enthralls today's reader with its odyssey of prophetic vision and gripping adventure.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780786406661","urn:ISBN:9780141441061","urn:ISBN:9780812970005","urn:ISBN:9780803298187","urn:ISBN:9780460874991","urn:ISBN:9780722189795","urn:ISBN:9780753820155","urn:ISBN:9780554334547","urn:ISBN:9781419193736"],"id":65221,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=P21bAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6500/?feed=opds","author":"Herbert George Wells","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Conditions sociales","Domestic fiction","Education","Education -- Fiction","England -- Fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","In library","Industrial revolution","Large type books","Literature","Married people","Mœurs et coutumes","Political fiction","PR","Problèmes sociaux","Protected DAISY","Romans, nouvelles","Social conditions","Social life and customs","Social problems","Social problems -- Fiction","Utilitarianism","Utilitarianism -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T20:16:53","language":"en","title":"Hard Times","issued":"1954-2012","summary":"Hard Times, by Charles Dickens, is part of the Barnes &amp; Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes &amp; Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices &amp; Glossaries, when appropriateAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes &amp; Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Set amid smokestacks and factories, Charles Dickens’s Hard Times is a blistering portrait of Victorian England as it struggles with the massive economic turmoil brought on by the Industrial Revolution. Championing the mind-numbing materialism of the period is Thomas Gradgrind, one of Dickens’s most vivid characters. He opens the novel by arguing that boys and girls should be taught “nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life.” Forbidding the development of imagination, Gradgrind is ultimately forced to confront the results of his philosophy—his own daughter’s terrible unhappiness. Full of suspense, humor, and tenderness, Hard Times is a brilliant defense of art in an age of mechanism. Karen Odden received her Ph.D. from New York University, where she did her dissertation on Victorian literature.

She started a new genre of magical adventures arising from everyday settings and has been much imitated. She was also a political activist and co-founded the Fabian Society, a precursor to the modern Labour Party. Nesbit's books for children are known for being entertaining without turning didactic, although some of her earlier works, notably Five Children and It (1902) and even more so The Story of the Amulet (1906), veer in that direction. Among Nesbit's best-known books are The Story of the Treasure Seekers (1898), The Wouldbegoods (1899) and The Railway Children (1906).

He was a remarkable man even by what was known of him; and that was but a small part of what he actually did. Although of a placid temper in ordinary circumstances, and accustomed to take the world with as much philosophy as any ploughman, the Prince of Bohemia was not without a taste for ways of life more adventurous and eccentric than that to which he was destined by his birth. Now and then, when he fell into a low humour, when there was no laughable play to witness in any of the London theatres, and when the season of the year was unsuitable to those field sports in which he excelled all competitors, he would summon his confidant and Master of the Horse, Colonel Geraldine, and bid him prepare himself against an evening ramble. The Master of the Horse was a young officer of a brave and even temerarious disposition. He greeted the news with delight, and hastened to make ready. Long practice and a varied acquaintance of life had given him a singular facility in disguise; he could adapt not only his face and bearing, but his voice and almost his thoughts, to those of any rank, character, or nation; and in this way he diverted attention from the Prince, and sometimes gained admission for the pair into strange societies. The civil authorities were never taken into the secret of these adventures; the imperturbable courage of the one and the ready invention and chivalrous devotion of the other had brought them through a score of dangerous passes; and they grew in confidence as time went on.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781846371684","urn:ISBN:9780877733829","urn:ISBN:9781847187895","urn:ISBN:9781421808598","urn:ISBN:9781604508420","urn:ISBN:9781466269101","urn:ISBN:9781406582185","urn:ISBN:9781426406799","urn:ISBN:9781404321038"],"id":65237,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=5ZJlPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6668/?feed=opds","author":"Robert Louis Stevenson","isOwn":false},{"category":["Children's stories, English","Classic Literature","Fairy tales","Fiction","Literature","OverDrive","PR","PZ","Short stories, English"],"updated":"2016-08-07T19:10:08","language":"en","title":"A House of Pomegranates","issued":"2004-2011","summary":"Oscar Wilde was born in 1856 in Dublin.

He told and retold his fairy tales to friends in private readings, refining them further each time before finally publishing them in two collections between 1888 and 1891 to great acclaim and lasting popularity ever since.

It is the only thing to do with it. It is never of any use to one's self.' An Ideal Husbandis a comic drama of political and personal deceit. Sir Robert Chiltern is the 'ideal husband' of the play's title, a brilliant young politician, whose eloquence and high principles have set him on the path to high office. His wife, Lady Chiltern, shares his ideals and is a great society beauty. They have the 'ideal' social and political partnership, but Sir Robert has a secret: in order to finance his entry into politics, he once sold confidential information to a sinister international profiteer. Threatened with the revelation of this secret by the glamorous adventuress Mrs Cheveley, Sir Robert turns to his best friend Lord Goring for advice - and thanks to the wit and resourcefulness of this wit and dandy, he has every prospect of being rescued from the revelations that would destroy his social and political career. Wilde's play was first performed in January 1895, the year of his own disgrace and imprisonment. This student edition contains a fully annotated version of the playtext. The introduction includes an account of Wilde's life and a detailed analysis of An Ideal Husbandas well as of its stage history.

It might have been any one. I fell into these things at a time when I thought myself removed from the slightest possibility of disturbing experiences. I had gone to Lympne because I had imagined it the most uneventful place in the world. &quot;Here, at any rate,&quot; said I, &quot;I shall find peace and a chance to work!&quot; And this book is the sequel. So utterly at variance is destiny with all the little plans of men. I may perhaps mention here that very recently I had come an ugly cropper in certain business enterprises. Sitting now surrounded by all the circumstances of wealth, there is a luxury in admitting my extremity. I can admit, even, that to a certain extent my disasters were conceivably of my own making. It may be there are directions in which I have some capacity, but the conduct of business operations is not among these. But in those days I was young, and my youth among other objectionable forms took that of a pride in my capacity for affairs.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780006147657","urn:ISBN:9780141441085","urn:ISBN:9780486414188","urn:ISBN:9781857987461","urn:ISBN:9780812968316","urn:ISBN:9780425036037","urn:ISBN:9780753820223","urn:ISBN:9781846375255","urn:ISBN:9780804900782"],"id":65261,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=HYQ8PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7163/?feed=opds","author":"H.

Yet he was unwilling to take leave, treating his engagement as settled, without some more conventional glance in that direction than he could find an opening for in the manner of the large affable lady who sat there drawing a pair of soiled gants de Suede through a fat jewelled hand and, at once pressing and gliding, repeated over and over everything but the thing he would have liked to hear. He would have liked to hear the figure of his salary; but just as he was nervously about to sound that note the little boy came back - the little boy Mrs. Moreen had sent out of the room to fetch her fan. He came back without the fan, only with the casual observation that he couldn't find it. As he dropped this cynical confession he looked straight and hard at the candidate for the honour of taking his education in hand. This personage reflected somewhat grimly that the thing he should have to teach his little charge would be to appear to address himself to his mother when he spoke to her - especially not to make her such an improper answer as that.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781595406491","urn:ISBN:9781406526783","urn:ISBN:9781163755068"],"id":65266,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=FrByBnvGqgsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7214/?feed=opds","author":"Henry James","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Adonis (Greek deity)","Adonis (Greek deity) -- Poetry","Biography","Classical Mythology","GITenberg","Latin Fables","Literature","Metamorphosis","Mythology","Poetry","PR","Sources","Translations into English","Venus (Roman deity)","Venus (Roman deity) -- Poetry"],"updated":"2016-08-08T14:58:01","language":"en","title":"Venus and Adonis","issued":"1593-2011","summary":"This book represents an authentic reproduction of the text as printed by the original publisher.

In total Bramah published 21 books and numerous short stories and features. His humorous works were ranked with Jerome K Jerome, and W. W. Jacobs; his detective stories with Conan Doyle; his politico-science fiction with H. G. Wells and his supernatural stories with Algernon Blackwood. George Orwell acknowledged that Bramah's book What Might Have Been (1907) influenced his seminal Nineteen Eighty-Four (1948). Bramah, the creator of the immortal Kai Lung and Max Carrados, was a recluse who refused to allow his public even the slightest glimpse of his private life - secrecy perhaps only matched by E. W. Hornung, the creator of Raffles, and today, J.D. Salinger. We now know that Bramah, whose real name was Smith, was a man of erudition and prescience with a unique style of writing that has never been copied. Among his most famous works are: Four Max Carrados Detective Stories (1914), Kai Lung's Golden Hours (1922), The Mirror of Kong Ho (1905) and The Wallet of Kai Lung (1900).","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780850468311","urn:ISBN:9781587152085","urn:ISBN:9781426406171","urn:ISBN:9780195840506","urn:ISBN:9781615340163","urn:ISBN:9781847028624","urn:ISBN:9781466268265","urn:ISBN:9781406589566","urn:ISBN:9781404338999"],"id":65273,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=pJKfPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7301/?feed=opds","author":"Ernest Bramah","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Classic Literature","Conduct of life -- Fiction","Egoism -- Fiction","Fate and fatalism -- Fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Literature","Man-woman relationships -- Fiction","OverDrive","PS"],"updated":"2016-08-08T17:09:16","language":"en","title":"The Beast in the Jungle","issued":"2003-2011","summary":"A obra apresenta uma história aparentemente comum sobre os encontros e desencontros entre John Marcher e May Bartram.

Young Umslopogaas, son of the bloodthirsty Zulu king Chaka, is forced to flee when Chaka orders his death. In the adventures that ensue, Umslopogaas is carried away by a lion and then rescued by Galazi, king of an army of ghost-wolves. Together, Umslopogaas and Galazi fight for glory and honour and to avenge their wrongs. With their fabled weapons, an axe called Groan-Maker and the club Watcher of the Woods, the two men become legendary warriors. But even these two unstoppable heroes may finally have met their match when the Zulu king sends his army of slayers to destroy them!

Renowned psychologist Paul Ekman's edited version of this book is the first to appear the way Darwin ultimately intended, with all of the corrections and additions that were in Darwin's notes for a revision that was never published during his lifetime. &quot;Why do we shrug? Why do dogs wag their tails? Why do we scowl when angry and pout when sad rather than the other way around? What is the difference between guilt and shame? This would be an extraordinary book even if it had only answered these and scores of similar questions about the emotions in 1872 . . . Darwin enriched his arguments with hundreds of insightful observations, many with the pathos and humor of great literature, as when he describes the terror of a man being led to his execution or the comical dejection of his dog as soon as it sensed that a walk might end . . .

Two decades have passed since the musketeers triumphed over Cardinal Richelieu and Milady. Time has weakened their resolve, and dispersed their loyalties. But treasons and strategems still cry out for justice: civil war endangers the throne of France, while in England Cromwell threatens to send Charles I to the scaffold. Dumas brings his immortal quartet out of retirement to cross swords with time, the malevolence of men, and the forces of history. But their greatest test is a titanic struggle with the son of Milady, who wears the face of Evil.

When &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; was published in 1915 it garnered immediate national attention for its truth and its shocking transgression of societal mores. A collection of poems from the graveyard of a rural Illinois town, &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; poignantly captures the politics, love, betrayals, alliances, hopes, and failures of this small American town. Here is the respected doctor, jailed for swindling; here is the chaste wife, rapt with desire; here is the pastor, angry and resentful; here is the quiet man, filled with unrequited love and devotion. Beneath the midwestern values of honesty, community, family, hard work, and chastity, &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; reveals the disillusionment and corruption in modern life. With the publication of &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; Masters exploded the powerful myth that small-town America was a social utopia. Here for the first time was a community that people recognized in its wholeness and complexity. Comprised of distinctly modern poems that collectively read as a novel, &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; is the story of a quiet midwestern town whose truths and contradictions are celebrated by its dead.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781406946130","urn:ISBN:9780486272757","urn:ISBN:9780451525307","urn:ISBN:9780020700104","urn:ISBN:9780451530585","urn:ISBN:9781580493390","urn:ISBN:9780252063633","urn:ISBN:9781843911081","urn:ISBN:9780684838250"],"id":65312,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=J_PVXwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7715/?feed=opds","author":"Edgar Lee Masters","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Brothers and sisters","Brothers and sisters -- Fiction","Children's literature","Children's literature, English","Classic Literature","Country life","Country life -- Fiction","England -- Fiction","GITenberg","OverDrive","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-08T19:38:18","language":"en","title":"Dream Days","issued":"1898-2011","summary":"Kenneth Grahame (1859-1932) was a British writer, mainly of the sort of fiction and fantasy written for children but enjoyed equally if not more by adults. He is most famous for The Wind in the Willows (1908), one of the classics of children's literature. He also wrote The Reluctant Dragon, which was much later adapted into a Disney movie. While still a young man, Grahame began to publish light stories in London periodicals such as the St. James Gazette. Some of these stories were collected and published as Pagan Papers in 1893, and, two years later, The Golden Age. These were followed by Dream Days in 1898, which contains The Reluctant Dragon. There is a ten-year gap between Grahame's penultimate book and the publication of his triumph, The Wind in the Willows. During this decade Grahame became a father. The wayward headstrong nature he saw in his little son he transformed into the swaggering Toad of Toad Hall, one of its four principal characters. Despite its success, he never attempted a sequel.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781435322684","urn:ISBN:9780898155464","urn:ISBN:9781585790180","urn:ISBN:9781853261664","urn:ISBN:9781843911951","urn:ISBN:9780380002887","urn:ISBN:9780825302817","urn:ISBN:9780862280598","urn:ISBN:9780370108933"],"id":66008,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=OkSMPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7728/?feed=opds","author":"Kenneth Grahame","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Autobiographical fiction","British -- Germany -- Fiction","Fiction in English","Gardening -- Fiction","Gardens -- Fiction","Germany -- Fiction","GITenberg","PR","Women gardeners -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-08T19:55:38","language":"en","title":"Elizabeth and her German garden","issued":"1976-2011","summary":"May 16th.-The garden is the place I go to for refuge and shelter, not the house.

It is simultaneously an epic quest across one of the most unusual and brilliantly depicted alien worlds ever conceived, a profoundly moving journey of discovery into the metaphysical heart of the universe, and a shockingly intimate excursion into what makes us human and unique. After a strange interstellar journey, Maskull, a man from Earth, awakens alone in a desert on the planet Tormance, seared by the suns of the binary star Arcturus. As he journeys northward, guided by a drumbeat, he encounters a world and its inhabitants like no other, where gender is a victory won at dear cost; where landscape and emotion are drawn into an accursed dance; where heroes are killed, reborn, and renamed; and where the cosmological lures of Shaping, who may be God, torment Maskull in his astonishing pilgrimage. At the end of his arduous and increasingly mystical quest waits a dark secret and an unforgettable revelation. A Voyage to Arcturus was the first novel by writer David Lindsay (1878–1945), and it remains one of the most revered classics of science fiction. This commemorative edition features an introduction by noted scholar and writer of speculative fiction John Clute and a famous essay by Loren Eiseley.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780486441986","urn:ISBN:9780803280045","urn:ISBN:9780575074835","urn:ISBN:9780862413774","urn:ISBN:9780345258441","urn:ISBN:9780722155417","urn:ISBN:9781604591453","urn:ISBN:9780806509440","urn:ISBN:9781617202216"],"id":66024,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=G1xGPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7821/?feed=opds","author":"David Lindsay","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Canadian fiction (English), CIHM","Children's literature, English","Children's stories, Canadian","City and town life -- Fiction","Classic Literature","Country life","Fiction","Friendship","GITenberg","Islands -- Fiction","Juvenile Fiction","Love","Orphans","OverDrive","Prince Edward Island -- Fiction","PS","PZ","Roman canadien-anglais, ICMH","Romans, nouvelles","Shirley, Anne (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","Young Adult Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-08T20:13:58","language":"en","title":"Chronicles of Avonlea","issued":"1970-2011","summary":" This is an OCR edition with typos. Excerpt from book: Ill EACH IN HIS OWN TONGUE The honey-tinted autumn sunshine was falling thickly over the crimson and amber maples around old Abel Blair's door. There was only one outer door in old Abel's house, and it almost always stood wide open. A little black dog, with one ear missing and a lame forepaw, almost always slept on the worn red sandstone slab which served old Abel for a doorstep; and on the still more worn sill above it a large gray cat almost always slept. Just inside the door, on a bandy-legged chair of elder days, old Abel almost always sat. He was sitting there this afternoon ? a little old man, sadly twisted with rheumatism; his head was abnormally large, thatched with long, wiry black hair; his face was heavily lined and swarthily sunburned; his eyes were deep-set and black, with occasional peculiar golden flashes in them. A strange looking man was old Abel Blair; and as strange was he as he looked, Lower Car- mody people would have told you. Old Abel was almost always sober in these, his later years. He was sober to-day. He liked to bask in that ripe sunlight as well as his dog and cat did; and in such baskings he almost always looked out of his doorway at the far, fine blue sky over the tops of the crowding maples. But to-day he was not looking at the sky; instead, he was staring at the black, dusty rafters of his kitchen, where hung dried meats and strings of onions and bunches of herbs and fishing tackle and guns and skins. But old Abel saw not these things; his face was the face of a man who beholds visions, compact of heavenly pleasure and hellish pain, for old Abel was seeing what he might have been ? and what he was; as he always saw when Felix Moore played to him on the violin.

Ere they mounted to resume their journey, the Christian knight again moistened his lips and dipped his hands in the living fountain, and said to his pagan associate, &quot; I would I knew the name of this delicious fountain, that I might hold it in grateful remembrance; for never did water slake more deliciously a more oppressive thirst than I have this day experienced.&quot; &quot; It is called in the Arabic language,&quot; answered the Saracen, &quot; by a name which signifies the Diamond of the Desert.&quot; &quot; And well is it so named,&quot; replied the Christian. &quot; My native valley hath a thousand springs, but not to one of them shall I attach hereafter such precious recollection as to this solitary fount, which bestows its liquid treasures where they are not only delightful, but nearly indispensable.'' They mounted, and pursued their journey across the sandy waste. The ardor of noon was now past, and a light breeze somewhat alleviated the terrors of the desert.

Tarzan the Untamed, first published in 1920, is the seventh book of Burroughs' tales of the ape-man. Here, Tarzan swears vengeance against the murderers of his wife as the conflagration of the Great War begins to burn a swathe through this corner of British East Africa. American novelist EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS (1875-1950) wrote dozens of adventure, crime, and science fiction novels that are still beloved today, including Tarzan of the Apes (1912), At the Earth's Core (1914), A Princess of Mars (1917), The Land That Time Forgot (1924), and Pirates of Venus (1934).

Dickens vowed to write a Christmas story every year after the resounding success of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; in 1843, and the three stories collected in this volume are holiday tales of kindness and redemption. Today, many people may not realize the debt they owe to Dickens -- his holiday stories almost single-handedly transformed Christmas from a disreputable holiday known for roughhousing and carousing, to the goodwill, charity and warmly-remembered traditions that the holiday represents today. As Dickens grew older, his fictional Christmases sometimes became far darker than the joyous holiday of &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot; The original edition of the Christmas magazine &quot;All the Year Round&quot; also included ghost stories, and tales by other popular writers. Mugby (a thinly-veiled version of &quot;Rugby&quot;) is a rail station situated in the British midlands. Well-known in the United Kingdom for its description of the unsavory railway refreshment room inspired by Dickens's 1865 train accident and a later, unpleasant repast, the rail station is a home base for the story of Jackson, a traveler who wanders into the station, alone and forlorn, at Christmastime.

His plays alone (leaving mere science out of the question), contain more actual wisdom than the whole body of English learning. He is the teacher of all good - pity, generosity, true courage, love. His bright wit is cut out &quot;into little stars.&quot; His solid masses of knowledge are meted out in morsels and proverbs, and thus distributed, there is scarcely a corner of the English-speaking world to-day which he does not illuminate, or a cottage which he does not enrich. His bounty is like the sea, which, though often unacknowledged, is everywhere felt. As his friend, Ben Jonson, wrote of him, &quot;He was not of an age but for all time.&quot; He ever kept the highroad of human life whereon all travel. He did not pick out by-paths of feeling and sentiment. In his creations we have no moral highwaymen, sentimental thieves, interesting villains, and amiable, elegant adventuresses - no delicate entanglements of situation, in which the grossest images are presented to the mind disguised under the superficial attraction of style and sentiment.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781599150291","urn:ISBN:9780765194909","urn:ISBN:9780897334853","urn:ISBN:9780760734049","urn:ISBN:9780195132137","urn:ISBN:9780486447629","urn:ISBN:9781604595758","urn:ISBN:9780195116892","urn:ISBN:9781434603296"],"id":66055,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=rpsqTU57gmMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8070/?feed=opds","author":"E.

Drolly but bitterly subtitled &quot;an essay in economic interpretation,&quot; this potent book condemns religious leaders for taking advantage of the credulity and hopefulness of ordinary Americans to line their own pockets and amass political influence. Not merely a brilliant work of persuasive journalism, this is also a document of the idealistic socialism that lingered after World War I, when the triumph of the movement's ideal still seemed possible. American writer UPTON SINCLAIR (1878-1968) was an active socialist and contributor to many socialist publications. His muckracking books include The Moneychangers (1908), King Coal (1917), Oil!

Sir Walter Scott was a master of diverse talents. He was a man of letters, a dedicated historian and historiographer, a well-read translator of foreign texts, and a talented poet. Deriving most of his material from his native Scotland, its history and its legends, Scott invented and mastered what we know today as the historical novel. The twelfth book in the Waverley series, the novel is based around the murder of Amy Robsart, a story told in William Julius Mickle's Cumnor Hall, one of Scott's favorite ballads as a child. The heroine Amy Robsart enters into a secret marriage with the Earl of Leicester, spurning her fianci, Edmund Tressilian, a Cornish gentleman. A favorite of Queen Elizabeth, Leicester feels obliged to conceal his marriage in order to maintain his position at court. Having fled her father's house, Amy is therefore kept a virtual prisoner in Cumnor Place, an old country house. After a series of intrigues and murder attempts she dies in a fall.

Developing many of the techniques at work in The Moonstone in bizarre and unexpected ways, and employing both Gothic and fantastic elements, The Law and the Lady adds a significant dimension to the history of the detective novel.

Specifically, in the fall of 1854, when the Hudson's Bay Company surveyor Dr. John Rae brought back Inuit reports of cannibalism among Franklin's men, Dickens was so perturbed that he launched a debate with Rae in the pages of his own periodical, Household Words. By 1856, however, it became increasingly clear that there were no survivors. It was in this context that, in the spring of 1856, Dickens and Collins conceived of a play set in the Arctic. The task of writing the play itself fell to Collins, since Dickens was still busily engaged with Little Dorritt, but nevertheless he found time to make numerous revisions to the eventual script. That play was rewritten by Wilkie Collins as this novel.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781846370380","urn:ISBN:9781843910947","urn:ISBN:9781846859793","urn:ISBN:9780750912068","urn:ISBN:9781438287386","urn:ISBN:9781843500926","urn:ISBN:9781466248250","urn:ISBN:9781592248919"],"id":66090,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=eJv1RT-fhDIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8643/?feed=opds","author":"Wilkie Collins","isOwn":false},{"category":["French fiction -- Translations into English","GITenberg","Literature","PQ"],"updated":"2016-08-09T19:46:46","language":"en","title":"At The Sign Of The Cat And Racket","issued":"2001-2007","summary":"The Comedy of Human Life (La Comédie Humaine) is the collective title given to a series of linked stories by Balzac, totalling about 100 in all, and loosely divided into groups, such as provincial, Parisian, political, military, and country.

I went down into the under-world of London with an attitude of mind which I may best liken to that of the explorer. I was open to be convinced by the evidence of my eyes, rather than by the teachings of those who had not seen, or by the words of those who had seen and gone before. Further, I took with me certain simple criteria with which to measure the life of the under-world. That which made for more life, for physical and spiritual health, was good; that which made for less life, which hurt, and dwarfed, and distorted life, was bad. It will be readily apparent to the reader that I saw much that was bad. Yet it must not be forgotten that the time of which I write was considered &quot;good times&quot; in England. The starvation and lack of shelter I encountered constituted a chronic condition of misery which is never wiped out, even in the periods of greatest prosperity. Following the summer in question came a hard winter. Great numbers of the unemployed formed into processions, as many as a dozen at a time, and daily marched through the streets of London crying for bread. Mr. Justin McCarthy, writing in the month of January 1903, to the New York Independent, briefly epitomises the situation as follows:- &quot;The workhouses have no space left in which to pack the starving crowds who are craving every day and night at their doors for food and shelter. All the charitable institutions have exhausted their means in trying to raise supplies of food for the famishing residents of the garrets and cellars of London lanes and alleys. The quarters of the Salvation Army in various parts of London are nightly besieged by hosts of the unemployed and the hungry for whom neither shelter nor the means of sustenance can be provided.&quot; It has been urged that the criticism I have passed on things as they are in England is too pessimistic. I must say, in extenuation, that of optimists I am the most optimistic. But I measure manhood less by political aggregations than by individuals. Society grows, while political machines rack to pieces and become &quot;scrap.&quot; For the English, so far as manhood and womanhood and health and happiness go, I see a broad and smiling future. But for a great deal of the political machinery, which at present mismanages for them, I see nothing else than the scrap heap.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781556521676","urn:ISBN:9781843914501","urn:ISBN:9781406814934","urn:ISBN:9780904526172","urn:ISBN:9780745318028","urn:ISBN:9780745314150","urn:ISBN:9781847780645","urn:ISBN:9780934710039","urn:ISBN:9781421815718"],"id":66098,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=B8iPPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8820/?feed=opds","author":"Jack London","isOwn":false},{"category":["Cargo ships -- Fiction","Children's literature, English","Classic Literature","Fiction","GITenberg","OverDrive","PQ","Sea stories","Ship captains -- Fiction","Shipwreck victims -- Fiction","Shipwrecks -- Fiction","Thriller"],"updated":"2016-08-09T19:56:03","language":"en","title":"The Survivors of the Chancellor","issued":"1978-2010","summary":"&quot;It probably arose,&quot; he answered, &quot;from the spontaneous combustion of the cotton.

Smith has a positive effect on the house - he creates his own court, brings a few couples together, and falls in love with a paid companion next door. All seems to be well with the world. Then the unexpected happens: Smith shoots at one of the tenants, and two doctors arrive to arrest him, claiming that he's a bigamist, an attempted murderer, and a thief. But cynical writer Moon insists that the case be tried there - and they explore Smith's past history, revealing startling truths about what he does. Is he the wickedest man in Britain, or is he &quot;blameless as a buttercup?&quot; Beautifully written, mixing the ridiculous with the profound, full of hilarious dialogue, and lushly detailed writing, Chesterton's main character Innocent Smith somehow manages to restore joy to all the dull and cynical lives around him. In this delightfully strange mystery, Chesterton demonstrates why life is worth living, and that sometimes we need a little madness just to know we are alive.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781406803044","urn:ISBN:9780486414058","urn:ISBN:9781463704643","urn:ISBN:9781936041831","urn:ISBN:9781603862110","urn:ISBN:9781586174798","urn:ISBN:9781453638439","urn:ISBN:9781604241396","urn:ISBN:9781466229501"],"id":66103,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=Aht2z6CzT6EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8907/?feed=opds","author":"G.

As Bette's insidious deceit relentlessly unravels the lives of the obsessive womanizer Baron Hulot and his angelic wife, Adeline, Balzac displays a sense of verbal comedy as acute as Dickens's and creates a world that is vivid and densely real. Henry James considered him the greatest of all novelists; in Cousin Bette Balzac gives ample proof of his genius.

He learned this from his father who worked in Philadelphia where Cowperwood's resourcefulness lifted his family above their modest beginnings to a more distinguished social environment. He was always surrounded by those who knew how money worked and understood how corporations operated. He labored hard and was convinced of his ultimate success. He trusted his intuition and used money to recompense his desire for a grand lifestyle by moving his business to Chicago. After the 1871 Chicago fire, a newspaper article hinted at the instability of financial obligations so that other businessmen demanded Cowperwood return their investments immediately. He used several exclusive methods to protect his assets and avoid bankruptcy but was finally accused of stealing. He was convicted and thrown in jail and handled his bad fortune by not losing hope. When he was released, he started a new life of achievement and affluence. His tenacity and focus made him one of the most authoritative people in the United States, and his advice on many financial topics was sought. This rise/fall/rise tale illustrates the ability of these fearless men to bring dreams into vivid reality.

A close friend of Charles Dickens, Collins is one of the most readable of the Victorian novelists and some critics credit him with the invention of Sensation/Detective novel. Originally serialized in The Cornhill, in Armadale the two heroes of the novel, Ozias Midwinter and Allan Armadale, are born under a curse since Midwinter's father had murdered Armadale's father. On his death bed, Midwinter's father warns that if these two sons ever meet, tragedy will occur. Midwinter learns the story and is uncertain whether to leave Allan or to work at changing their fate. The novel also features a doctor who is running a clandestine abortion clinic. When that operation is shut down by the police, he opens a private sanitarium for monetary gain. When the local ladies come to tour the facilities he espouses a system of liberal care, when in actuality the building is laid out with an intricate system of pipes that allow him to keep his patients continually sedated. At the novel's end, the doctor is found to be planning a murder using those pipes.

Andre-Louis Moreau, (or Scaramouche, as he later becomes known), is a fascinatingly complex protagonist. Courageous, intelligent, quick-witted and intensely moral, Moreau is a character whose personal quest for revenge against the villainous Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr is a masterfully-woven story of swashbuckling action, romance and social conflict during the turbulent years of the French Revolution. Scaramouche is a well-born lawyer, fugitive, dramatic actor, expert swordsman, revolutionary politician and mob-inciting orator. Sabatini sets Moreau upon an intriguing path of fate, development and discovery, a fictionalized yet compelling account of a single man's ultimate test of human character as the world around him spirals into madness. Rafael Sabatini has often been compared to Alexandre Dumas (author of the Three Musketeers, the Count of Monte Cristo) as a master of historical fiction. Sabatini has created in Scaramouche an historical action-adventure novel that transcends all modern action-adventure writers in that Moreau, his protagonist, is a thoroughly multi-dimensional character. Though Moreau is driven by his hatred and quest for revenge, the spirit of his character is not defined by them, and the conflict of these passions with his ideals brings depth and substance to his exploits on the Theatre Feydau, the fencing halls of Paris, the floor of the National Assembly and his pursuit of the beautiful Aline de Kercadiou. Duels, intrigue, political introspection, romance, and more duels-all are present in Scaramouche.

Kirkpatrick, who expanded Lewis' love for Greek literature, mythology, and reason. On the other hand, he enlisted in the British army to fight in the trenches of World War I, a messy reality that must have seemed irreconcilable to the beauty of words and clarity of reason he had come to know through his studies.Not surprisingly, this moving, masterfully crafted cycle of lyrics is marked both by Romanticism and Cynicism. Beauty and the trenches are equally present in these poems. They show us an anguished soul that struggles with the conflicting experiences in this world.Come and join C. S.

Wodehouse was admired both by contemporaries like Rudyard Kipling as well as by modern writers like Terry Pratchett. Best known today for the Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels and short stories, Wodehouse was also a talented playwright and lyricist who was part author and writer of fifteen plays and of 250 lyrics for some thirty musical comedies.

Her own annotations make fascinating reading.&quot; The daring and restless mind, the integrity and simplicity of Darwin's character are revealed in this direct and personal account of his life'his family, his education, his explorations of the natural world, his religion and philosophy.

He has tracked her to a hidden valley called Pal-ul-don, which means &quot;Land of Men.&quot; In Pal-ul-don Tarzan finds a real Jurassic Park filled with dinosaurs, notably the savage Triceratops-like Gryfs, which unlike their prehistoric counterparts are carnivorous. The lost valley is also home to two different races of tailed human-looking creatures, the Ho-don (hairless and white skinned) and the Waz-don (hairy and black-skinned). Tarzan befriends Ta-den, a Ho-don warrior, and Om-at, the Waz-don chief of the tribe of Kor-ul-ja. In this new world he becomes a captive but so impresses his captors with his accomplishments and skills that they name him Tarzan-Jad-Guru (Tarzan the Terrible), which is the name of the novel.Jane is also being held captive in Pal-ul-don, having been brought there by her German captor, who has since become dependent on her due to his own lack of jungle survival skills. She becomes a pawn in a religious power struggle that consumes much of the novel.With the aid of his native allies, Tarzan continues to pursue his beloved to rescue her and set things to right, going through an extended series of fights and escapes to do so. In the end success seems beyond even his ability to achieve, until in the final chapter he and Jane are saved by their son Korak, who has been searching for Tarzan just as Tarzan has been searching for Jane.

Consider the case of Henry Pifield Rice, detective. I must explain Henry early, to avoid disappointment. If I simply said he was a detective, and let it go at that, I should be obtaining the reader's interest under false pretences. He was really only a sort of detective, a species of sleuth. At Stafford's International Investigation Bureau, in the Strand, where he was employed, they did not require him to solve mysteries which had baffled the police. He had never measured a footprint in his life, and what he did not know about bloodstains would have filled a library. The sort of job they gave Henry was to stand outside a restaurant in the rain, and note what time someone inside left it. In short, it is not 'Pifield Rice, Investigator.

Though a man of the modern world, Adams remained in temperament a child of the 18th century, his political ideals shaped by his presidential ancestors, great-grandfather John Adams and grandfather John Quincy Adams. The Education of Henry Adams is both a brilliant memoir and a profound meditation on the extraordinary developments in science, politics, religion, and society that so transformed the world as he knew it.

He sketches a series of encounters with the cultural shrines of the parent nation, and in two brilliant experiments with tales transplanted from Europe creates the first classic American short stories, 'Rip Van Winkle' and 'The Legend of the Sleepy Hollow'. Based on Irving's final revision of his most popular work, this new edition includes comprehensive explanatory notes of The Sketch-Book's sources for the modern reader.

Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature's greatest writers. In The ART OF THE NOVELLA series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time. Published the same year as her first novel, Adam Bede, this overlooked work displays the gifts for which George Eliot would become famous—gritty realism, psychological insight, and idealistic moralizing. It is unique from all her other writing, however, in that it represents the only time she ever used a first-person narrator, and it is the only time she wrote about the supernatural. The tale of a man who is incapacitated by visions of the future and the cacophony of overheard thoughts, and yet who can’t help trying to subvert his vividly glimpsed destiny, it is easy to read The Lifted Veil as being autobiographically revealing—of Eliot’s sensitivity to public opinion and her awareness that her days concealed behind a pseudonym were doomed to a tragic unveiling (as indeed came to pass soon after this novella’s publication). But it is easier still to read the story as the exciting and genuine precursor of a moody new form, as well as an absorbing early masterpiece of suspense.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781406524529","urn:ISBN:9780140161168","urn:ISBN:9780146001697","urn:ISBN:9780860687054","urn:ISBN:9780976658306","urn:ISBN:9781406851410","urn:ISBN:9781449987770","urn:ISBN:9781466265721","urn:ISBN:9781605970431"],"id":66148,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=QRTcGAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10165/?feed=opds","author":"George Eliot","isOwn":false},{"category":["Bicycle touring -- Fiction","Black Forest (Germany) -- Fiction","British","British -- Germany -- Fiction","Description and travel","Fiction","GITenberg","Humorous stories","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-23T15:55:39","language":"en","title":"Three Men on the Bummel","issued":"1900-2011","summary":"Conceived as a fairly serious guide to amateur boating on the Thames in 1889, Jerome K. Jerome's best-known novel ended up as a hilarious account of the misadventures of three friends and a dog as they attempt to relax and enjoy themselves amid unreliable weather forecasts, imaginary illnesses, repellent cooking, and an unopenable can of pineapple chunks. Three Men in a Boat was a terrific success for its author, and a surprisingly accurate portrayal of the age. George, Harris, and J., the narrator, were entertaining representatives of the new middle class, seeking to escape the dreary world of offices and desks during weekend trips out into the countryside. Jerome's heroes proved so popular that he brought them back for an equally picaresque bicycle tour of Germany, an adventure recorded in Three Men on the Bummel. The new Introduction by Jeremy Lewis describes the social context of the two books and the remarkable life of their author.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781421800615","urn:ISBN:9780140621457","urn:ISBN:9780140063929","urn:ISBN:9781604506358","urn:ISBN:9780862990299","urn:ISBN:9780140623987","urn:ISBN:9780904380293","urn:ISBN:9781466276147","urn:ISBN:9781420934168"],"id":66149,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=kCOXPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10222/?feed=opds","author":"Jerome K.

Unfortunately, in these days of rush and hurry, a novelist works at a disadvan-tage. He must leap into the middle of his tale with as little delay as he would employ in boarding a moving tramcar. He must get off the mark with the smooth swiftness of a jack-rabbit surprised while lunching. Otherwise, people throw him aside and go out to picture palaces. I may briefly remark that the present Lord Marshmore-ton is a widower of some forty-eight years: that he has two children-a son, Percy Wilbraham Marsh, Lord Belpher, who is on the brink of his twenty-first birth-day, and a daughter, Lady Patricia Maud Marsh, who is just twenty: that the chatelaine of the castle is Lady Caroline Byng, Lord Marshmoreton's sister, who married the very wealthy colliery owner, Clifford Byng, a few years before his death (which unkind people say she hastened): and that she has a step-son, Reginald. Give me time to mention these few facts and I am done. On the glorious past of the Marshmoretons I will not even touch.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140015997","urn:ISBN:9781585674305","urn:ISBN:9780099514138","urn:ISBN:9781441495860","urn:ISBN:9781841591247","urn:ISBN:9781466275225","urn:ISBN:9780257657394","urn:ISBN:9781450514521","urn:ISBN:9781153582155"],"id":66152,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=lSm3QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10279/?feed=opds","author":"Pelham Grenville Wodehouse","isOwn":true},{"category":[" Drama","Aristocracy (Social class)","Banking law","Christian converts from Judaism","Comedies","English Authors","Fathers and daughters","Jews -- Italy -- Drama","Jews in fiction","justice","Moneylenders -- Drama","PR","Venice (Italy) -- Drama"],"updated":"2016-08-23T16:34:33","language":"en","title":"The Merchant of Venice","issued":"2000","summary":"","id":135668,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10303/?feed=opds","author":"William Shakespeare","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","BJ","Conduct of life","GITenberg","Nonfiction","OverDrive","Self-Improvement","Time management","Values"],"updated":"2016-08-23T16:52:14","language":"en","title":"How to live on twenty-four hours a day","issued":"1975-2011","summary":"&quot;How to Live on 24 Hours a Day,&quot; a classic personal time-management book originally published in 1908 has inspired generations of men and women to live deliberate lives. The arguments are witty and thought-provoking and ultimately persuasive, and the humor, though subtle, is effective. The author has an authoritative yet pleasant writing style that preempts rationalizations about why it won &quot;t work. Not just another collection of timesaving tips, &quot;How to Live on 24 Hours a Day&quot; is more of a challenge to leave behind mundane everyday concerns, focus on pursuing one's true desires, and live the fullest possible life. Reflection, concentration, and study techniques make it easier to accomplish more truly rewarding undertakings than anyone ever dreamed possible. This book was recommended as a 'must read' in Dale Carnegie's 'How to develop self-confidence and influence people be public speaking' course. Though written a century ago, &quot;How to Live on 24 Hours a Day&quot; addresses the inadequacies, frustrations, and disappointments of people today in all walks of life--and it does so with humor and wisdom. A daily dose of this small work is at least as nourishing for the brain and soul as a multi-vitamin for the body. When writing this little book, Arnold Bennett created a classic of its kind, a self-help book that really helps. While it is hard to imagine that such a short book could be so persuasive, it is truly a classic and an early precursor to many others that have attempted to demonstrate how time is our own and ours to manage and expand our boundaries of our selves. In the thirty minutes it takes to read, you will be left forever vigilant, and will never sit idle, unless you consciously choose to sit idle, while you ride a train, wait for plane, or drive home from what once may have been a routine. Read it, study it, and live again.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780518191131","urn:ISBN:9780967972800","urn:ISBN:9781599869780","urn:ISBN:9780486454450","urn:ISBN:9780979415487","urn:ISBN:9781602060746","urn:ISBN:9781604595079","urn:ISBN:9781449528492","urn:ISBN:9781600960741"],"id":66162,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=iP2aPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10392/?feed=opds","author":"Arnold Bennett","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Adventure stories","Bumppo, Natty (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","Classic Literature","Fiction","Frontier and pioneer life","Frontier and pioneer life -- New York (State) -- Fiction","GITenberg","Historical fiction","History","Literature","Natty Bumppo (Fictitious character)","New York (State) -- History -- 1775-1865 -- Fiction","OverDrive","PS","Thriller"],"updated":"2016-08-23T16:53:40","language":"en","title":"The pioneers","issued":"1964-2011","summary":"With The Pioneers (1823), Cooper initiated his series of elegiac romances of frontier life and introduced the world to Natty Bumppo (or Leather-stocking).

This is especially true ofThe Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, Darwin's second most important work. This edition is a facsimile reprint of the first printing of the first edition (1871), not previously available in paperback.The work is divided into two parts. Part One marshals behavioral and morphological evidence to argue that humans evolved from other animals. Darwin shoes that human mental and emotional capacities, far from making human beings unique, are evidence of an animal origin and evolutionary development. Part Two is an extended discussion of the differences between the sexes of many species and how they arose as a result of selection. Here Darwin lays the foundation for much contemporary research by arguing that many characteristics of animals have evolved not in response to the selective pressures exerted by their physical and biological environment, but rather to confer an advantage in sexual competition. These two themes are drawn together in two final chapters on the role of sexual selection in humans.In their Introduction, Professors Bonner and May discuss the place ofThe Descentin its own time and relation to current work in biology and other disciplines.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140436310","urn:ISBN:9780691023694","urn:ISBN:9781573921763","urn:ISBN:9780691082783","urn:ISBN:9780760763117","urn:ISBN:9780486471648","urn:ISBN:9781420933994","urn:ISBN:9781903933268","urn:ISBN:9781595478863"],"id":66167,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=SOiEo1tEnsoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10482/?feed=opds","author":"Charles Darwin","isOwn":false},{"category":["Authorship","English Authors","English fiction -- 19th century","Fiction","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-24T14:33:14","language":"en","title":"A house to let","issued":"2002-2009","summary":"Charles John Huffam Dickens (1812-1870), also known as &quot;Boz,&quot; was the foremost English novelist of the Victorian era, as well as a vigorous social campaigner.

In the lucid, unadorned prose that was her hallmark, Cather brings to life the simple Nebraska farm folk and their tranquil rural lifestyle, showing how the Great War, seemingly so far away on the Old Continent, eventually touches them all. More than half of the novel is devoted to the Wheeler homestead, the pace following the slow rhythms of the prairie farmland. The novel's protagonist, Claude Wheeler, a strong, healthy, red-headed farm boy, is physically a typical representative of his sturdy sodbuster family and hard-working neighbors. But mentally the boy has little in common with their narrow outlooks, and the limited horizons of his parochial community make him restless and filled with a barely suppressed discontent. Through a series of striking vignettes, Cather brilliantly reveals Claude's search for some greater purpose to his life beyond the routines of farm life. Gradually, the widening war in Europe sneaks up on the rural Nebraska region, as newspaper reports of refugees and German atrocities begin to stir the emotions of the local young men. When the United States finally enters the conflict, Claude is one of the first to enlist, seeing purpose, adventure, and commitment to some larger ideal in the call to arms. Claude's longings for radically new experiences are more than amply realized overseas in sobering encounters with suffering French women and children, the battle-scarred English &quot;Tommies, &quot; and the tenacious German enemy. The novel concludes with a memorable testament to theshattering effects of war on youth and ideals, a powerful depiction of mechanized battle, and its life-changing effects on one Nebraska farm boy and the people he left behind.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780394712529","urn:ISBN:9780679737445","urn:ISBN:9781461039822","urn:ISBN:9781153674874","urn:ISBN:9780860685029","urn:ISBN:9780803214316","urn:ISBN:9780486455990","urn:ISBN:9781603125079","urn:ISBN:9781604594942"],"id":66174,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=9QPEQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10725/?feed=opds","author":"Willa Cather","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Adventure and adventurers","Bildungsromans","Boys","Boys -- Fiction","Boys in fiction","Child witnesses","Child witnesses -- Fiction","Child witnesses in fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Highlands (Scotland) -- Fiction","Mute persons","Mute persons -- Fiction","Mute persons in fiction","Orphans","Orphans -- Fiction","Orphans in fiction","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-25T09:37:22","language":"en","title":"Sir Gibbie","issued":"1963-2011","summary":" This is an OCR edition with typos. Excerpt from book: CHAPTER III. MISTRESS CROALE. The house at which they met had yet not a little character remaining. Mistress Croale had come in for a derived worthiness, in the memory, yet lingering about the place, of a worthy aunt deceased, and always encouraged in herself a vague idea of obligation to live up to it. Hence she had made it a rule to supply drink only so long as her customers kept decent?that is, so long as they did not quarrel aloud, and put her in danger of a visit from the police; tell such tales as offended her modesty; utter oaths of any peculiarly atrocious quality; or defame the Sabbath Day, the Kirk, or the Bible. On these terms, and so long as they paid for what they had, they might get as drunk as they pleased, without the smallest offence to Mistress Croale. But if the least unquestionable infringement of her rules occurred, she would pounce upon the shameless one with sudden and sharp reproof. I doubt not that, so doing, she cherished a hope of recommending herself above, and making deposits in view of a coming balance-sheet. The result for this life so far was, that, by these claims to respectability, she had gathered a clientele of douce, well disposed drunkards, who rarely gave her any trouble so long as they were in the house, though sometimes she had reason to be anxious about the fate of individuals of them after they left it. Another peculiarity in her government was that she would rarely give drink to a woman. &quot;Na, na,&quot; she would say, &quot;what has a wuman to dee wi' strongdrink!

In &quot;The New Atlantis,&quot; Bacon focuses on the duty of the state toward science, and his projections for state-sponsored research anticipate many advances in medicine and surgery, meteorology, and machinery. Although &quot;The New Atlantis&quot; is only a part of his plan for an ideal commonwealth, this work does represent Bacon's ideological beliefs. The inhabitants of Bensalem represent the ideal qualities of Bacon the statesman: generosity and enlightenment, dignity and splendor, piety and public spirit. These were the ideal qualities which Bacon wanted to see in 17th century England. In &quot;The New Atlantis,&quot; Bacon breaks from Plato, Aristotle and other ancient writers by insisting that humans do not need to aspire to fewer desires because the extraordinary advances of science would make it possible to appease bodily desires by providing material things that would satisfy human greed. For Bacon there is no reason to waste time and energy trying to get human beings to rise to a higher moral state. Ultimately, Bacon clearly sees the advances of science as the best way of increasing humanity's control over nature and providing for the comfort and convenience of all people, and England's Royal Society and similar organizations dedicated to scientific progress are generally regarded as embodying Bacon's utopian vision. The utopia of &quot;The New Atlantis&quot; underscores the idea that science will solve the evils of this world.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781564592309","urn:ISBN:9788562022357","urn:ISBN:9781162891064","urn:ISBN:9781604241167","urn:ISBN:9781605974675","urn:ISBN:9781406504149","urn:ISBN:9781434101891","urn:ISBN:9781595479006","urn:ISBN:9781451537635"],"id":66573,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=vL8d2mjR4VIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10800/?feed=opds","author":"Francis Bacon","isOwn":false},{"category":[" Drama","Accessible book","GITenberg","In library","Literature","Norwegian drama","Norwegian drama -- Translations into English","Physicians -- Drama","Plays","Pollution -- Drama","Protected DAISY","PT","Social conditions","Social conflict -- Drama","Springs -- Drama"],"updated":"2016-08-25T09:49:20","language":"en","title":"An enemy of the people","issued":"1970-2012","summary":"&quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; was one of Henrik Ibsen's more controversial works. In the play, Dr. Stockmann discovers that the new baths built in his town are infected with a deadly disease that requires they should be closed for repair. However, the mayor of the town (the Burgomaster), who is Stockmann's brother Peter, rejects the report and refuses to close the baths because it will bring about the financial ruin of the town. When Dr. Stockmann tries to make his case to the people of the town, the mayor counters by pointing out how expensive it would be to repair the baths and dismisses the doctor for having wild, fanciful ideas. At the public meeting Dr. Stockmann is declared &quot;an enemy of the people&quot; by the Burgomaster. As is the case with most of Ibsen's classic works, &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; speaks to larger issues than those in conflict in the play. The debate is over the bad water pipes at the new baths, but the true conflict is over the clash of private and public morality. Both of the Stockman brothers are flawed. Dr. Stockman's idealism is at odds with the practical realities of the world in which he lives while the Burgomaster ignores ethical concerns. Still, in the end we have to favor the doctor over the mayor because his integrity is clearly stronger, while still recognizing that his idealism is tragically flawed.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780571194292","urn:ISBN:9780486406572","urn:ISBN:9781595406446","urn:ISBN:9781404350236","urn:ISBN:9781406501445","urn:ISBN:9781153585972","urn:ISBN:9781566637275","urn:ISBN:9780435224639","urn:ISBN:9781461036722"],"id":66578,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=iZkhv-B2Tg4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10833/?feed=opds","author":"Henrik Ibsen","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Arnold, Thomas, 1795-1842","Biografías","Biography","DA","GITenberg","Gordon, Charles George, 1833-1885","Great Britain -- Biography","Great Britain -- History -- Victoria, 1837-1901 -- Biography","History","In library","Literary Criticism","Literature","Manning, Henry Edward, 1808-1892","Nightingale, Florence, 1820-1910","Nurses","Physicians","Protected DAISY","Social conditions"],"updated":"2016-08-25T09:50:20","language":"en","title":"Eminent Victorians","issued":"1918-2011","summary":"Eminent Victorians is a groundbreaking work of biography that raised the genre to the level of high art.

This edition is unique in being fully annotated and in drawing on the full range of Strachey's manuscript materials and literary remains.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781555843533","urn:ISBN:9780140183504","urn:ISBN:9780192801586","urn:ISBN:9780140006490","urn:ISBN:9780156286978","urn:ISBN:9780679640127","urn:ISBN:9780747502180","urn:ISBN:9780156027892","urn:ISBN:9780199555017"],"id":66582,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=qwhrHgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10839/?feed=opds","author":"Lytton Strachey","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Charles Edward, Prince, grandson of James II, King of England, 1720-1788 -- Fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Great Britain","Historical fiction","History","Jacobites","Jacobites -- Fiction","Law students","Law students -- Fiction","PR","Princes","Princes -- Fiction","Scotland -- History -- 18th century -- Fiction","Social life and customs"],"updated":"2016-08-25T18:07:33","language":"en","title":"Redgauntlet","issued":"1906-2011","summary":"Arguably Scott's finest novel, and the last of his major Scottish novels, Redgauntlet centers around a third, fictitious, Jacobite rebellion set in the summer of 1765. The novel's hero, young Darsie Latimer, is kidnapped by Edward Hugh Redgauntlet, a fanatical supporter of the Stewart cause, and finds himself caught up in the plot to install the exiled Bonnie Prince Charlie on the British throne. First published in 1824, this is perhaps Scott's most complex statement about the relation between history and fiction. This new edition features the Magnum text of 1832, the last to be corrected by Scott, and it includes Scott's own notes. This reissue is the only available critical edition and it includes a fine introduction by Kathryn Sutherland, who examines the historical context, the novel's structure and style, and the story itself. The book also includes an up-to-date bibliography, a timeline of Scottish history in the period relating to the novel, a chronology of Scott's life and work, full explanatory notes, and a glossary of Scots words.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780140436556","urn:ISBN:9780192816689","urn:ISBN:9780192836908","urn:ISBN:9780460011419","urn:ISBN:9780199599578","urn:ISBN:9780231107204","urn:ISBN:9780460001410","urn:ISBN:9780748605804","urn:ISBN:9781148212173"],"id":66587,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=ahoVYMFwIAYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11034/?feed=opds","author":"Sir Walter Scott","isOwn":false},{"category":[" 20th century","Accessible book","Autobiographical fiction","Classic Literature","England -- Fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Literature","Marriage","Marriage -- Fiction","Married people","OverDrive","PR","Teachers","Teachers -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-25T19:22:06","language":"en","title":"The Longest Journey","issued":"1960-2011","summary":"Edward Morgan Forster, OM (1879-1970), was an English novelist, short story writer, and essayist. He is known best for his ironic and well-plotted novels examining class difference and hypocrisy in early 20th-century British society. His humanistic impulse toward understanding and sympathy may be aptly summed up in the epigraph to his 1910 novel Howards End. He had five novels published in his lifetime. He achieved his greatest success with A Passage to India (1924). The novel takes as its subject the relationship between East and West, seen through the lens of India in the later days of the British Raj. His views as a secular humanist are at the heart of his work, which often depicts the pursuit of personal connections in spite of the restrictions of contemporary society. He is noted for his use of symbolism as a technique in his novels, and he has been criticised for his attachment to mysticism. His other works include Where Angels Fear to Tread (1905), The Longest Journey (1907), A Room with a View (1908) and Maurice (1971).","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781404313811","urn:ISBN:9780141441481","urn:ISBN:9780679748151","urn:ISBN:9780140014709","urn:ISBN:9780140180862","urn:ISBN:9780141185842","urn:ISBN:9780394700403","urn:ISBN:9780553214550","urn:ISBN:9780340552315"],"id":66597,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=qOd3PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11268/?feed=opds","author":"E.

The Rosenthal case, where four men, headed by a genial individual calling himself Gyp the Blood&quot; shot a fellow-citizen in cold blood in a spot as public and fashionable as Piccadilly Circus and escaped in a motor-car, made such a stir a few years ago that the noise of it was heard all over the world and not, as is generally the case with the doings of the gangs, in New York only.

Excerpt from book: CHAPTER III. UNCLES. WHEN Rose woke next morning, she was not sure whether she had dreamed what occurred the night before, or it had actually happened. So she hopped up and dressed, although it was an hour earlier than she usually rose, for she could not sleep any more, being possessed with a strong desire to slip down and see if the big portmanteau and packing-cases were really in the hall. She seemed to remember tumbling over them when she went to bed, for the aunts had sent her off very punctually, because they wanted their pet nephew all to themselves. The sun was shining, and Rose opened her window to let in the soft May air fresh from the sea. As she leaned over her little balcony, watching an early bird get the worm, and wondering how she should like Uncle Alec, she saw a man leap the garden wall and come whistling up the path. At first she thought it was some trespasser, but a second look showed her that it was her uncle returning from an early dip into the sea. She had hardly dared to look at him the night before, because whenever she tried to do so she always found a pair of keen blue eyes looking at her. Nowshe could take a good stare at him as he lingered along, looking about him as if glad to see the old place again. A brown, breezy man, in a blue jacket, with no hat on the curly head which he shook now and then like a water-dog; broad-shouldered, alert in his motions, and with a general air of strength and stability about him which pleased Rose, though she could not explain the feeling of comfort it gave her. She had just said to herself, with a sense of relief, &quot; I guess I shall like him, though he looks as if he made people mind,&quot; when he lifted his eyes to examine the budding horse-chestnut overhead, and saw the eager face peering down at him.

He was right. In the midst of Great Power politics a play which drew substance from one of the fourteenth-century liberation movements proved both attractive and inflammatory. Since then the work as become immensely popular. This new English translation by William F. Mainland brings out the essential tragi-comic nature of Wilhelm Tell but also emphasizes its impressive formal unity. Schiller based his play on chronicles of the Swiss liberation movement, in which Wilhelm Tell played a major role. Since Tell's existence has never been proven, Schiller, a historian by profession, felt he had to devise a figure who would bring the uncertainties and contradictions of the various Swiss chronicles into focus. Respected for his courage and skill with a bow, for his peaceable nature and his integrity, Schiller's archer—while always ready to aid his fellows—habitually seeks solitude. In the midst of political turmoil Wilhelm Tell is the nonpolitical man of action. Keenly interested in the problematic interplay of history and legend, Schiller turned it to be dramatic advantage. He constructed his play to illustrate the greatest possible development of the character traits suggested for Tell by the chronicles. The result of Schiller's supreme achievement in historical drama.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780226738000","urn:ISBN:9780226738017","urn:ISBN:9780382069475","urn:ISBN:9780719004261","urn:ISBN:9781153735339","urn:ISBN:9781103629336","urn:ISBN:9781406820539","urn:ISBN:9781165783236","urn:ISBN:9781436885980"],"id":66620,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=FC3_PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11733/?feed=opds","author":"Friedrich Schiller","isOwn":false},{"category":["Early works to 1800","GITenberg","HX","Political Science","Utopias","Utopias -- Early works to 1800"],"updated":"2016-08-29T13:26:44","language":"en","title":"The commonwealth of Oceana ; and, A system of politics","issued":"1992","summary":"Pocock explores the the life and pivotal career of James Harrington.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780521411899","urn:ISBN:9780521423298"],"id":66625,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=A6pgQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11791/?feed=opds","author":"James Harrington","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","California, Southern -- Fiction","Children's literature, English","Didactic fiction","Fiction","Girls","GITenberg","History","In library","Indian women","Indians of North America","Indians of North America -- Fiction","Indians, Treatment of -- Fiction","Literature","Love","Love stories","Mexicans","Political fiction","Protected DAISY","PS","Racially mixed people","Racially mixed people -- Fiction","Treatment of Indians","United States War with Mexico, 1845-1848","Zamorano 80"],"updated":"2016-08-29T13:26:48","language":"en","title":"Ramona","issued":"1976-2010","summary":" This is an OCR edition with typos.

Ramona was, to the world at large, a far more important person than the Senora herself. The Senora was of the past; Ramona was of the present. For one eye that could see the significant, at times solemn, beauty of the Senora's pale and shadowed countenance, there were a hundred that flashed with eager pleasure at the barest glimpse of Ramona's face; the shepherds, the herdsmen, the maids, the babies, the dogs, the poultry, all loved the sight of Ramona; all loved her, except the Senora. The Senora loved her not; never had loved her, never could love her; and yet she had stood in the place of mother to the girl ever since her childhood, and never once during the whole sixteen years of her life had shown her any unkindness in act. She had promised to be a mother to her; and with all the inalienable stanchness of her nature she fulfilled the letter of her promise. More than the bond lay in the bond; but that was not the Senora's fault. The story of Ramona the Senora never told. To most of the Senora's acquaintances now, Ramona was a mystery. They did not know ? and no one ever asked a prying question of the Senora Moreno ? who Ramona's parents were, whether they were living or dead, or why Ramona, her name not being Moreno, lived always in the Senora's house as a daughter, tended and attended equally with the adored Felipe. A few gray-haired men and women here and there in the country could have told the strange story of Ramona; but its beginning was more than a half-centuryback, and much had happened since then.

Campanella's utopia was based on a form of communism in which all possessions, including women and children, were shared by men. The great city was ruled by a spiritual leader named Metaphysic, whom Power, Wisdom, and Love served, overseeing all aspects of the society. Wisdom ensures that the sciences are properly taught, while Love ensures that men and women breed the most perfect children. Those with an interest in philosophy and sociology will find this book an intriguing take on the structure of an ideal society. Italian philosopher and theologian TOMMASO CAMPANELLA (1568-1639) became a monk at the age of fifteen. He was imprisoned for twenty-seven years for conspiring against the Spanish crown, and it was during this time that he wrote his most important works, including Atheismus triumphatus (1605) and Metaphysica (1609).","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781406512434","urn:ISBN:9780520040366","urn:ISBN:9780904526165","urn:ISBN:9781419156878","urn:ISBN:9781602068872","urn:ISBN:9781603862882","urn:ISBN:9780520040342","urn:ISBN:9781141553174"],"id":66632,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=SE4-PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11836/?feed=opds","author":"TOMMASO CAMPANELLA","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","English literature","GITenberg","In library","Literature","Poetry","PR","Protected DAISY","Soldiers","Soldiers -- Poetry"],"updated":"2016-08-29T13:35:55","language":"en","title":"The barrack-room ballads of Rudyard Kipling","issued":"1973-2009","summary":"A passage from the book...

Prolific English writer of novels dealing with Victorian life. Framley Parsonage is one of the volumes of his Barsetshire series, which is for the most part set in the imaginary west country county of Barset and its chief town, Barchester. The Barset novels are where Trollope first begins to use the device of using reappearing characters in different books. The book begins: When young Mark Robarts was leaving college, his father might well declare that all men began to say all good things to him, and to extol his fortune in that he had a son blessed with so excellent a disposition. This father was a physician living at Exeter. He was a gentleman possessed of no private means, but enjoying a lucrative practice, which had enabled him to maintain and educate a family with all the advantages which money can give in this country. Mark was his eldest son and second child; and the first page or two of this narrative must be consumed in giving a catalogue of the good things which chance and conduct together had heaped upon this young man's head.

He won the Nobel Prize in 1907. Born in India in 1865 to an upper-class military family, he spent his early years in Britain and India and achieved his initial success as a reporter in India. In 1888 he published these short stories: Soldiers Three, The Story of the Gadsbys, In Black and White, Under the Deodars, The Phantom Rickshaw and Wee Willie Winkie. The Light that Failed and The City of Dreadful Night were written by him in 1890.He traveled widely and visited the U.S. a number of times, eventually building a house in Vermont. A restless wanderer, he ultimately settled in Sussex, only to have his world tumble into ruins with the death of his son in World War I. Kipling is revered for his adult and children's stories and poems, but much of his life and writing is largely unknown in the United States. (Because he believed, and wrote, that Americans were ignorant provincials, his political views were not appreciated in the states.) Witty, profound, wildly funny, acerbic and occasionally savage, Rudyard Kipling's writings continue to delight readers of all ages.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780543919441","urn:ISBN:9780140185126","urn:ISBN:9780140432831","urn:ISBN:9780804901994","urn:ISBN:9780140030549","urn:ISBN:9781906469191","urn:ISBN:9781421840093","urn:ISBN:9780881842777","urn:ISBN:9788184569087"],"id":66638,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=QWw31lzodhAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/12001/?feed=opds","author":"Rudyard Kipling","isOwn":false},{"category":["Children's literature, English","Description and travel","Equator -- Description and travel","G","GITenberg","Travel","Twain, Mark, 1835-1910 -- Travel","Voyages and travels","Voyages around the world"],"updated":"2016-08-29T20:33:17","language":"en","title":"Following the equator","issued":"1897-2011","summary":"Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), better known by the pen name Mark Twain, was an American humorist, satirist, lecturer and writer. Twain is most noted for his novels The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885). He is also known for his quotations. His first important work, The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, was published in 1865. His next publication was The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which drew on his youth in Hannibal. The character of Tom Sawyer was modeled on twain as a child, with traces of two schoolmates, John Briggs and Will Bowen. His next major published work, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, solidified him as a noteworthy American writer. Some have called it the first Great American Novel. Finn was an offshoot from Tom Sawyer and proved to have a more serious tone than its predecessor. The main premise behind Huckleberry Finn is the young boy's belief in the right thing to do even though the majority of society believes that it was wrong.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780404015770","urn:ISBN:9780486261133","urn:ISBN:9780792238768","urn:ISBN:9780880015189","urn:ISBN:9780880012805","urn:ISBN:9780880015196","urn:ISBN:9781404303263","urn:ISBN:9780880012973","urn:ISBN:9781420931204"],"id":66639,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=TUxVYAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/12058/?feed=opds","author":"Mark Twain","isOwn":false},{"category":[" 20th century","Classic Literature","Culture conflict","Culture conflict -- Fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Historical fiction","Humorous stories","Literature","Middle class","Middle class -- England -- Fiction","OverDrive","PR","Protected DAISY"],"updated":"2016-08-29T21:17:49","language":"en","title":"Where angels fear to tread","issued":"1905-2011","summary":"True and Complete Edition: A wonderful story of questioning, disillusionment, and conversion. It tells the story of a prim English family's encounter with the foreign land of Italy. When attractive, impulsive English widow Lilia marries Gino, a dashing and highly unsuitable Italian 12 years her junior, her snobbish former in-laws make no attempt to hide their disapproval. But their expedition to face the uncouth foreigner takes an unexpected turn when they return to Italy under tragic circumstances intending to rescue Lilia and Gino's baby. Forster displays his finely honed talent for using the tragi-comic incident to comment on human existence. Where Angels Fear To Tread is much more than a comedy of manners - it demonstrates how a clash of cultural sensibilities can quickly turn from comedy to tragedy. This is a classic to come and read again and again. A superb book that you will remember long after you read it. Making your own discovery of Angels is part of the attraction.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780679736349","urn:ISBN:9780141441450","urn:ISBN:9780486277912","urn:ISBN:9780140180886","urn:ISBN:9780140013443","urn:ISBN:9781419193774","urn:ISBN:9780141185316","urn:ISBN:9781604502077","urn:ISBN:9781463717728"],"id":66641,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=2WnW-gupDXsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/12184/?feed=opds","author":"Edward Morgan Forster","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Brothers and sisters","Classic Literature","Fiction","GITenberg","Identity","Lady's maids","Lady's maids -- Fiction","Love stories","Man-woman relationships","OverDrive","PR","Wessex (England) -- Fiction","Women","Young women","Young women -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-30T03:36:53","language":"en","title":"Desperate remedies","issued":"1975-2010","summary":"Hardy's first published work, Desperate Remedies moves the sensation novel into new territory. The anti-hero, Aeneas Manston, as physically alluring as he is evil, even fascinates the innocent Cytherea, though she is in love with another man. When he cannot seduce her, Manston resorts to deception, blackmail, bigamy, murder, and rape. Yet this compelling story also raises the great questions underlying Hardy's major novels, which relate to the injustice of the class system, the treatment of women, probability and causality. This edition shows for the first time that the sensation novel was always Hardy's natural genre. It is based on the first edition text, and includes later prefaces and the Wessex Poems &quot;dissolved&quot; into prose.

His daughter Grace wishes to marry Major Henry Grantly, the son of Archdeacon Grantly, who considers her unworthy of his son, although acknowledging that she is a lady of merit. Her courtship with Henry is further jeopardized when Mr. Crawley is accused of theft by writing a counterfeit check, which he cannot remember committing. The ensuing trial upsets the entire parish of Barset and threatens to tear apart Reverend Crawley's family. While clearly a satirical story of a society's materialism, &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot; also reveals Trollope's attention to the most minute details of human behavior. In depicting the complex character of the Reverend Crawley, the author creates a man full of self-doubt, whose pride has been humiliated time and again by the demeaning effects of destitution, and whose increasingly disconsolate state of mind threatens to prove a tragedy.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780192835345","urn:ISBN:9780140437522","urn:ISBN:9780192815446","urn:ISBN:9780140430240","urn:ISBN:9781853262319","urn:ISBN:9780195208092","urn:ISBN:9780679443667","urn:ISBN:9781857152081","urn:ISBN:9780460872348"],"id":66648,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=MtilPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/12469/?feed=opds","author":"Anthony Trollope","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adventure and adventurers -- Fiction","Amazon River -- Fiction","Brazil -- Social life and customs -- Fiction","Children's literature, English","Classic Literature","Fiction","GITenberg","OverDrive","Peru -- Social life and customs -- Fiction","PQ","Rafts -- Fiction","Science Fiction","Thriller","Voyages and travels -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-12T15:50:37","language":"en","title":"Eight Hundred Leagues on the Amazon (Dodo Press)","issued":"2005-2011","summary":"Many regard Jules Verne (1828-1905) as the father of modern science fiction. After running away to sea at the age of 11, and getting sent home in disgrace, Verne took up writing. His early works, mostly plays and librettos, met with little success. His first novel, &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon,&quot; based on extensive readings on science and geography, led him to a career writing adventure stories infused with meticulously accurate scientific elements. Novels such as &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth,&quot; &quot;From the Earth to the Moon,&quot; &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,&quot; and many others followed, earning him a place as one of the most popular authors of all time, read by millions thorughout the world. &quot;Eight Hundred Leagues on the Amazon&quot; (sometimes split into two volumes, &quot;The Giant Raft&quot; and &quot;The Cryptogram&quot;) tells of a blackmail victim forced on trip down the Amazon to clear his good name.

Viviette, the married lady of the manor, is nine years older than Swithin St Cleve, the 20-year old `Adonis-astronomer', a `lad of striking beauty, scientific attainments, and cultivated bearing', the orphaned son of a curate who married the daughter of a family of farmers. The story of their love, both complex and remarkable, involves adultery and accidental polygamy. On publication some reviewers considered the novel to be immoral, and one suggested that the treatment of the Bishop of Melchester might be regarded as a `studied and gratuitous insult aimed at the Church'. This sensational tale is informed throughout by the astronomical images and reflections which were preoccupying Hardy at the time of the book's composition. This is the first critical edition of 'Two on a Tower'. Based on a study of the manuscript and Hardy's revised printed versions, it presents a text in which many variants make their appearance in print for the first time.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780312827427","urn:ISBN:9780140435368","urn:ISBN:9780333177570","urn:ISBN:9780192829191","urn:ISBN:9780460877848","urn:ISBN:9780554376042","urn:ISBN:9780140435597","urn:ISBN:9780333417515","urn:ISBN:9780192836410"],"id":66656,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=nX-LPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/12758/?feed=opds","author":"Thomas Hardy","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Barsetshire (England : Imaginary place)","Barsetshire (England: Imaginary place) -- Fiction","Children of clergy","Children of clergy in fiction","Classic Literature","Clergy","Clergy in fiction","Country life -- Fiction","Domestic fiction","England -- Social life and customs -- 19th century -- Fiction","England in fiction","Fathers and daughters","Fathers and daughters in fiction","Fiction","Great Britain -- History -- 19th century -- Fiction","In library","Inheritance and succession -- Fiction","Love stories","Man-woman relationships","Man-woman relationships in fiction","Nieces -- Fiction","OverDrive","Physicians -- Fiction","PR","Protected DAISY","Social life and customs"],"updated":"2016-09-13T17:51:09","language":"en","title":"Dr Thorne","issued":"1968-2011","summary":"Title: Doctor Thorne.

Of these Udolpho is by far the most famous, and may be taken as a type of the early Gothic tale at its best. It is the chronicle of Emily, a young Frenchwoman transplanted to an ancient and portentous castle in the Apennines through the death of her parents and the marriage of her aunt to the lord of the castle -- the scheming nobleman, Montoni. Mysterious sounds, opened doors, frightful legends, and a nameless horror in a niche behind a black veil all operate in quick succession to unnerve the heroine and her faithful attendant, Annette; but finally, after the death of her aunt, she escapes with the aid of a fellow-prisoner whom she has discovered. On the way home she stops at a chateau filled with fresh horrors -- the abandoned wing where the departed chatelaine dwelt, and the bed of death with the black pall -- but is finally restored to security and happiness with her lover Valancourt, after the clearing-up of a secret which seemed for a time to involve her birth in mystery. Clearly, this is only familiar material re-worked; but it is so well re-worked that Udolpho will always be a classic. Mrs. Radcliffe's characters are puppets, but they are less markedly so than those of her forerunners. And in atmospheric creation she stands pre'minent among those of her time.&quot; -- H. P.

In this his most popular novel, the chronicler continues the story of Mr. Harding and his daughter Eleanor, begun in The Warden, adding to his cast of characters that oily symbol of 'progress' Mr. Slope, the hen-pecked Dr. Proudie, and the amiable and breezy Stanhope family. Love, mammon, clerical in-fighting and promotion again figure prominently and comically, all centred on the magnificently imagined cathedral city of Barchester. The central questions of this moral comedy - Who will be warden? Who will be dean? Who will marry Eleanor? - are skilfully handled with the subtlety of ironic observation that has won Trollope such a wide and appreciative readership over the last 140 years. For this new edition, John Sutherland has contributed an introduction and extensive notes, as well as a chronology of the novel's composition and current events, and a note on Trollopian names.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780850671056","urn:ISBN:9780140432039","urn:ISBN:9780192834324","urn:ISBN:9781853260896","urn:ISBN:9780140620214","urn:ISBN:9780192815071","urn:ISBN:9780199537655","urn:ISBN:9780679405870","urn:ISBN:9780451518811"],"id":66673,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=hjaESQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13525/?feed=opds","author":"Anthony Trollope","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Fiction","GITenberg","Historical fiction","History","In library","Italy -- History -- 1815-1870 -- Fiction","Italy -- History -- Revolution of 1848 -- Fiction","OverDrive","PR","Protected DAISY","Revolutionaries -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-14T14:50:41","language":"en","title":"The Gadfly","issued":"1973-2011","summary":"The Gadfly (1897) by Ethel Lillian Voynich is a startling multi-layered story of ideological transformation, love, and legendary, superhuman courage. It encapsulates the life of Arthur Burton and his transition from a delicate and beautiful, innocent youth to a disillusioned and outspoken revolutionary hero, a remarkable man who undergoes a crisis of faith and becomes the proverbial Gadfly. The Gadfly is an ordinary man with human failings and weaknesses, a secret love, and a complex burden of pain. And yet he is larger than life, a superhero of fortitude, an atheist and humanist, an outspoken opponent of the political status quo and a proponent of freedom for the people; his words devastate and sting his enemies by the force of truth they convey. Set in Italy during the tumultuous period of political unrest in the middle of the nineteenth century, this unusual novel was an inspirational bestseller abroad, particularly remarkable in its emotional impact. And now it deserves to be discovered by a whole new generation of readers.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780809533435","urn:ISBN:9781406816372","urn:ISBN:9780583121804","urn:ISBN:9781934169117","urn:ISBN:9781438509815","urn:ISBN:9780766194922","urn:ISBN:9781404304673","urn:ISBN:9781153703369","urn:ISBN:9781934169100"],"id":66676,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=3t9HPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13588/?feed=opds","author":"E.

In his youth he had written many verses and in December 1867 he had been awarded the first prize of 3 at the Kyneton Literary Society for a vigorous set of verses on The Death of President Lincoln. His most famous work is Such is Life (1903), a fictional account of the life of rural dwellers, including bullock drivers, squatters and itinerant travellers, in southern New South Wales and Victoria, during the 1880s. In 1905, he moved to Western Australia, where his sons were living. He built a house at Swanbourne, which is now the headquarters of the West Australian branch of the Fellowship of Australian Writers. Furphy's popularity may have influenced the usage of the Australian slang word furphy, meaning a &quot;tall story.&quot; However, scholars consider it more likely that the word originated with water carts, produced in large numbers by J. Furphy &amp; Sons, a company owned by Joseph's brother John.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781414224428","urn:ISBN:9780207131943","urn:ISBN:9780195530896","urn:ISBN:9780207158193","urn:ISBN:9781875684304","urn:ISBN:9780858357037","urn:ISBN:9780701206949","urn:ISBN:9781864760743","urn:ISBN:9780207154768"],"id":66678,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=xnygPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13705/?feed=opds","author":"Joseph Furphy","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adventure and adventurers -- Fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","PS","Science Fiction","Tibet Autonomous Region (China) -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-14T15:23:22","language":"en","title":"The metal monster","issued":"1974-2008","summary":"Abraham Merritt (1884-1943), who published under the byline A. Merritt, was an American editor and author of works of fantastic fiction. Originally trained in law, he turned to journalism, first as a correspondent, and later as editor. He was assistant editor of The American Weekly from 1912 to 1937 under Morrill Goddard, then its editor until his death. He was a major influence on H. P. Lovecraft, and highly esteemed by his friend and frequent collaborator Hannes Bok. Merritt's stories typically revolve around conventional pulp magazine themes: lost civilizations, hideous monsters, etc. His heroes are gallant Irishmen or Scandinavians, his villains treacherous Germans or Russians and his heroines often virginal, mysterious and scantily clad. What sets Merritt apart from the typical pulp author, however, is his lush, florid prose style and his exhaustive, at times exhausting, penchant for adjective-laden detail. His fondness for micro-description nicely complements the pointillistic style of Bok's illustrations. He wrote Through the Dragon Glass, and The People of the Pit (1917), The Moon Pool (1918), The Metal Monster (1920), and Three Lines of Old French.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780967321516","urn:ISBN:9780881849790","urn:ISBN:9780380008629","urn:ISBN:9780883551431","urn:ISBN:9781404319608","urn:ISBN:9781406574258"],"id":66679,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=G-sBAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13726/?feed=opds","author":"Abraham Merritt","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adventure stories","Africa -- Fiction","Balloons -- Fiction","Children's literature, English","Ficción","Fiction","GITenberg","PQ","Science Fiction","Travel -- Fiction","Viajes alrededor del mundo","Voyages around the world"],"updated":"2016-09-15T11:14:45","language":"en","title":"Five Weeks in a Balloon","issued":"1869-2010","summary":"&quot;The chiefs are armed with muskets,&quot; said he, &quot;and our balloon is too easy a mark for them.&quot; &quot;Would a hole make us fall?&quot; asked Joe. &quot;Not immediately; but the hole would soon become a vast rent, through which all our gas would escape.&quot; &quot;Then let us keep at a respectful distance.

With a keen, withering eye, Wollstonecraft, one of the founding mothers of modern feminism, of course offers her insightful observations on the condition of womanhood in these northerly nations. But she also delights the reader with poetic portraits of the landscapes, observations on the rural and urban societies she encounters, and the particular difficulties encountered by a woman travelling alone, with only her infant daughter and a nursemaid for company... especially a woman who asks &quot;men's questions&quot; of those she meets along the way. First collected in book form in 1796, these letters display a strikingly modern attitude from a woman who was far ahead of her time. British writer and educator MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT (1759-1797), the mother of Frankenstein author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, espoused her then-radical feminist and liberal philosophies in such works as Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), and History and Moral View of the Origins and Progress of the French Revolution (1793).","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780199230631","urn:ISBN:9780803258327","urn:ISBN:9780900001512","urn:ISBN:9780803208629","urn:ISBN:9781596055377","urn:ISBN:9781108018890","urn:ISBN:9780554380872","urn:ISBN:9780548750926","urn:ISBN:9781606800379"],"id":66681,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=nkZTtwlvE9EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13801/?feed=opds","author":"Mary Wollstonecraft","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Anecdotes","Canada -- Social life and customs -- Fiction","City and town life","City and town life -- Fiction","City and town life in literature","Fiction","GITenberg","In literature","Literature","OverDrive","Protected DAISY","PS","Satire","Satire and humour, Canadian (English), CIHM","Satire et humeur canadiennes-anglaises, ICMH","Social life and customs"],"updated":"2016-09-15T11:21:04","language":"en","title":"Sunshine sketches of a little town","issued":"1970-2011","summary":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town is a sequence of stories by Stephen Leacock, first published in 1912.

You may find them all the way from Lake Superior to the sea, with the same square streets and the same maple trees and the same churches and hotels.&quot; This work has remained popular for its universal appeal. Many of the characters, though modeled on townspeople of Orillia, are small town archetypes.

The play is of interest because of its influence on the course of city comedy and its wealth of information about social relationships and colloquial language at the end of Elizabeth's reign.

S. Eliot as crucial to understanding &quot;The Waste Land,&quot; Jessie Weston's book has continued to attract readers interested in ancient religion, myth, and especially Arthurian legend. Weston examines the saga of the Grail, which, in many versions, begins when the wounded king of a famished land sees a procession of objects including a bleeding lance and a bejewelled cup. She maintains that all versions defy uniform applications of Celtic and Christian interpretations, and explores the legend's Gnostic roots.Drawing from J. G. Frazer, who studied ancient nature cults that associated the physical condition of the king with the productivity of the land, Weston considers how the legend of the Grail related to fertility rites--with the lance and the cup serving as sexual symbols. She traces its origins to a Gnostic text that served as a link between ancient vegetation cults and the Celts and Christians who embellished the story. Conceiving of the Grail saga as a literary outgrowth of ancient ritual, she seeks a Gnostic Christian interpretation that unites the quest for fertility with the striving for mystical oneness with God.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780691021072","urn:ISBN:9780486296807","urn:ISBN:9781596053236","urn:ISBN:9781452807997","urn:ISBN:9781605200613","urn:ISBN:9780862205058","urn:ISBN:9781404350427","urn:ISBN:9781463748616","urn:ISBN:9781856520676"],"id":66711,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=rA_7zkMcgP4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15392/?feed=opds","author":"Jessie Laidlay Weston","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Culture","Great Britain -- Social conditions -- 19th century","HN","Literature","Protected DAISY","Social conditions"],"updated":"2016-09-19T14:49:49","language":"en","title":"Culture and anarchy","issued":"1932-2010","summary":"Without the challenging precedent of Culture and Anarchy, literary criticism and sociology in England and the United States would want both purpose and direction.

Arnold employs a delicate and stringent irony in an examination of the society of his time: a rapidly expanding industrial society, just beginning to accustom itself to the changes in its institutions that the pace of its own development called for. Coming virtually at the end of the decade (1868) and immediately prior to W. E. Forster's Education Act, Culture and Anarchy phrases with a particular cogency the problems that find their centre in the questions: what kind of life do we think individuals in mass societies should be assisted to lead? How may we best ensure that the quality of their living is not impoverished? Arnold applies himself to the detail of his time: to the case of Mr Smith 'who feared he would come to poverty and be eternally lost', to the Reform agitation, to the commercial values that working people were encouraged to respect, and to the limitations of even the best Rationalist intelligence. The degree of local reference is therefore high, but John Dover Wilson's introduction and notes to this edition supply valuable assistance to a reader fresh to the period.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780300058666","urn:ISBN:9780192805119","urn:ISBN:9780300058673","urn:ISBN:9780521091039","urn:ISBN:9780199538744","urn:ISBN:9780672609947","urn:ISBN:9781404301177","urn:ISBN:9780877543299","urn:ISBN:9781426415043"],"id":66712,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=bLpiQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15787/?feed=opds","author":"Matthew Arnold","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Bildungsromans","Children of physicians","Children of physicians -- Fiction","Domestic fiction","England -- Fiction","Fathers and daughters","Fathers and daughters -- Fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","In library","Literature","Love stories","PR","Protected DAISY","Social classes","Social classes -- Fiction","Social conditions","Social life and customs","Stepfamilies","Stepfamilies -- Fiction","Women","Young women","Young women -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-19T15:42:25","language":"en","title":"Wives and daughters","issued":"1866-2011","summary":"Wives and Daughters, by Elizabeth Gaskell, is part of the Barnes &amp; Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes &amp; Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices &amp; Glossaries, when appropriateAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes &amp; Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Tremendously popular in her lifetime, Elizabeth Gaskell has often been overshadowed by her contemporaries the Brontës and George Eliot. Yet the reputation of her long-neglected masterpiece Wives and Daughters continues to grow, fulfilling Henry James’s prophecy that the novel would “continue for years to come to be read and relished . . .so delicately, so elaborately, so artistically, so truthfully, and heartily is the story wrought out.” An enchanting tale of romance, scandal, and intrigue in the gossipy English town of Hollingford around the 1830s, Wives and Daughters tells the story of Molly Gibson, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a widowed country doctor. When her father remarries, she forms a close friendship with her new stepsister—the beautiful and worldly Cynthia—until they become love rivals for the affections of Squire Hamley’s sons, Osbourne and Roger. When sudden illness and death reveal some secrets while shrouding others in even deeper mystery, Molly feels that the world is out of joint and it is up to her—trusted by all but listened to by none—to set it right. Amy M. King is Assistant Professor of English at St. John’s University in New York City and the author of Bloom: The Botanical Vernacular in the English Novel (Oxford University Press, 2003).","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781466307513","urn:ISBN:9789100120016","urn:ISBN:9780460876513","urn:ISBN:9780140434781","urn:ISBN:9781593082574","urn:ISBN:9781840224160","urn:ISBN:9780199538263","urn:ISBN:9780142437001","urn:ISBN:9781169366220"],"id":66717,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=30pQpwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15956/?feed=opds","author":"Elizabeth Gaskell","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","GITenberg","Literature","PS","Short stories, American","Social life and customs"],"updated":"2016-07-27T12:13:18","language":"en","title":"Flappers and philosophers","issued":"1972-2010","summary":"F. Scott Fitzgerald followed up his smash debut novel, &quot;This Side of Paradise,&quot; with &quot;Flappers and Philosophers.&quot; This 1920 collection of short stories contains several of Fitzgerald's signature pieces, including &quot;Bernice Bobs Her Hair&quot; and &quot;Benediction.&quot; Though &quot;Flappers and Philosophers&quot; was F. Scott Fitzgerald's first short story collection, he was already a master of the genre. The stories in this classic are an entertaining group, brimming with the spirit of youth. Fitzgerald shows considerable skill in depicting horror in ''The Ice Palace'' as well as ''The Cut-Glass Bowl.'' Although Fitzgerald wrote to H.L. Mencken that ''Bernice'' was ''trash,'' the story is strong in showing the workings of peer pressure and popularity seeking. ''Flappers and Philosophers'' was dedicated to Fitzgerald's wife, the spirited and mercurial Zelda. Fittingly, we meet a Zelda on the very first page -- Ardita Farnam of ''The Offshore Pirate.'' ''Pirate'' is a romance that dwarfs contemporary Harlequin-type gruel. Most of the stories have at least one good plot twist. ''Dalyrimple Goes Wrong'' and ''Head and Shoulders'' are the best of the twisters. Though F. Scott Fitzgerald is known best today for &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; that novel was a commercial flop during Fitzgerald's lifetime. It was &quot;Flappers and Philosophers,&quot; together with &quot;Tales of the Jazz Age,&quot; that led pre-Depression America to fall in love with F. Scott Fitzgerald, pushed him to celebrity and paid his bill. Fitzgerald may not have been overly fond of his short stories, but his writing skill and insight continue to shine in &quot;Flappers and Philosophers.&quot;","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780671550998","urn:ISBN:9780743451512","urn:ISBN:9780307474520","urn:ISBN:9781406509564","urn:ISBN:9781600969256","urn:ISBN:9781153622356","urn:ISBN:9780020652908","urn:ISBN:9781451537178","urn:ISBN:9780521402361"],"id":66724,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=C53DAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4441/?feed=opds","author":"Francis Scott Fitzgerald","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Literature","PR","Religious fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-19T17:20:40","language":"en","title":"A Romance of Two Worlds","issued":"1986-2009","summary":"This is a pre-1923 historical reproduction that was curated for quality.

The smooth and springy sward that stretched in front of the house was all composed of a tiny yellow clover. It gave beneath the foot like the pile on velvet. One's gaze looked forth from it upon the endless middle distances of the oak-clad Weald, with the uncertain blue line of the South Downs in the background. Ridge behind ridge, the long, low hills of paludina limestone stood out in successive tiers, each thrown up against its neighbor by the misty haze that broods eternally over the wooded valley; till, roaming across them all, the eye rested at last on the rearing scarp of Chanctonbury Ring, faintly pencilled on the furthest skyline. Shadowy phantoms of dim heights framed the verge to east and west. Alan Merrick drank it in with profound satisfaction. After those sharp and clear-cut Italian outlines, hard as lapis lazuli, the mysterious vagueness, the pregnant suggestiveness, of our English scenery strikes the imagination; and Alan was fresh home from an early summer tour among the Peruginesque solidities of the Umbrian Apennines. &quot;How beautiful it all is, after all,&quot; he said, turning to his entertainer. &quot;In Italy 'tis the background the painter dwells upon; in England, we look rather at the middle distance.&quot;","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781551115108","urn:ISBN:9780192823120","urn:ISBN:9781605121055","urn:ISBN:9781406507669","urn:ISBN:9781161481334","urn:ISBN:9781421801377","urn:ISBN:9781406804133"],"id":66728,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=1bjhFu8C7hcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16298/?feed=opds","author":"Grant Allen","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Christian fiction","Christian life","Christian life.","Christian sociology","Clergy","Clergy -- Fiction","Faith","Fiction","GITenberg","In library","Influence","Jesus Christ -- Influence -- Fiction","Protected DAISY","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-19T19:02:43","language":"en","title":"In his steps","issued":"1897-2012","summary":"The penetrating and provocative question 'What would Jesus do?' in all of life's complex situations, is the central theme of this book. It is the soul-stirring novel of men and women torn between their faith and the demands, compulsions, and temptations of life. Dr. Henry Maxwell, respected pastor of the First Church of Raymond, struggled with the idea that Christian discipleship demanded more than mental assent. He vowed to preface every attitude and action of his own life with the question: What would Jesus do in this situation if He were me? Electrifying his congregation with the same challenge, people responded with agreement to try it for one year. This book is the moving, dramatic story of a handful of Americans--a newspaper editor, a college president, a railroad executive, a pastor, a singer, a writer, a wealthy philanthropist--who pledge to walk in 'the steps of Jesus.' At each turning point in their daily lives, they must ask: 'What would Jesus do?' For decades, readers have been gripped by this narrative and have been challenged by its implications for their own lives. In His Steps is a convincing testimony to the worth and influence of Christian witness in all of life.

Narrated by an unheroic, apparently rudderless hero named Random, Smollett's wildly energetic and entertaining novel is held together not least by the narrator's outrage and dismay. Although Roderick Random was first published anonymously, the secret of Smollett's authorship was soon discovered, with the result that many readers thought they recognized similarities between the life of the hero and that of his creator. Certainly Roderick Random's early years - disinherited and without wealth and influence - and his university career, apprenticeship and service as a naval surgeon, vividly reflect the experiences of the author. How Random learns to survive the fickle hand of fortune, recovers his long-lost father, marries his beloved Narcissa, and dispatches his enemies is the stuff, not of autobiography but of a novel which profoundly satirizes the moral chaosof its times. Dickens and Thackeray, among other great Victorians, applauded Smollett for his wit and invention, and in Roderick Random we enjoy the novel of a pioneer opening up the frontiers of fiction.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780375400674","urn:ISBN:9780140433258","urn:ISBN:9780192815521","urn:ISBN:9781853262234","urn:ISBN:9780140621778","urn:ISBN:9780460877947","urn:ISBN:9781162708522","urn:ISBN:9780192840769","urn:ISBN:9780140438161"],"id":66850,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=XZ-wQQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16883/?feed=opds","author":"Anthony Trollope","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","Adventure and adventurers","Adventure and adventurers in fiction","Adventure stories","Cartoons and comics","Children's literature, English","Ciencia-ficción","Classic Literature","Core","Earth","Earth (Planet) -- Core -- Fiction","Earth in fiction","Explorers","Explorers in fiction","Fiction","French Science fiction","GITenberg","Imaginary Voyages","Imaginary voyages in fiction","In library","Juvenile Fiction","Large type books","OverDrive","PQ","Protected DAISY","Science Fiction","Thriller","Voyages and travels","Voyages and travels in fiction","Voyages, Imaginary -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-21T19:11:57","language":"fr","title":"Voyage au centre de la terre","issued":"1971-2010","summary":"Dans la petite maison du vieux quartier de Hambourg où Axel, jeune homme assez timoré, travaille avec son oncle, l'irascible professeur Lidenbrock, géologue et minéralogiste, dont il aime la pupille, la charmante Graüben, l'ordre des choses est soudain bouleversé.

We put our grizzled heads together, we older ones, and we talk of the great days that we have known; but we find that when it is with our children that we talk it is a hard matter to make them understand. We and our fathers before us lived much the same life, but they with their railway trains and their steamboats belong to a diffe-rent age. It is true that we can put history-books into their hands, and they can read from them of our weary struggle of two and twenty years with that great and evil man. They can learn how Freedom fled from the whole broad continent, and how Nelson's blood was shed, and Pitt's noble heart was broken in striving that she should not pass us for ever to take refuge with our brothers across the Atlantic. All this they can read, with the date of this treaty or that battle, but I do not know where they are to read of ourselves, of the folk we were, and the lives we led, and how the world seemed to our eyes when they were young as theirs are now.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781595404039","urn:ISBN:9781458968036","urn:ISBN:9781112559181","urn:ISBN:9781147507447","urn:ISBN:9781440084249"],"id":66870,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=T1ifRgH3d7cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/20420/?feed=opds","author":"ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE","isOwn":false},{"category":["Accessible book","call-girl","Classic Literature","decadent France.

La grandeur de Zola est de faire passer dans son oeuvre monumentale le savoir de son temps et d'apporter à ce travail de titan non seulement les fruits d'une large expérience politique et sociale, acquise notamment dans le journalisme, mais aussi et surtout le concours décisif d'un souffle romantique et d'un tempérament épique.

He went to New College, Oxford University for three years on a Rhodes Scholarship, studying modern history. He moved to Philadelphia where he got his start as a newspaper reporter and then columnist for various publications. In 1920, he returned to New York City and took a job writing the column The Bowling Green for the New York Evening Post. He was one of the founders and long-time contributing editor of the Saturday Review of Literature. Out of enthusiasm for the Sherlock Holmes stories, he became the founder of the Baker Street Irregulars and wrote the introduction to the standard omnibus edition of The Complete Sherlock Holmes. Author of more than 100 books of essays, poetry, and novels, he is probably best known as the author of Kitty Foyle (1939), which was made into an Academy Award-winning movie.

Robert S. Miola presents a meticulously edited and modernized version of the play as originally acted by the Lord Chamberlain's Men (with Shakespeare in the cast) in 1598. He has collated all fifteen known copies of the quarto and consulted the revised folio version as well, so instead of simply endorsing the folio version as the superior play, the introduction seeks to understand the quarto version on its own terms. Miola explores the relevance of the Italian setting, particularly the potent, variegated, and fascinating body of myth and legend that constituted Italy for English audiences in 1598. The editor also illuminates the dramatic context of the play, outlining the rise of 'humors' comedy in Jonson and contemporaries like Chapman, Marston and Shakespeare. He gives detailed attention to the social, political and religious contexts of the play as well showing how larger cultural struggles shape the characters and action of the play. The textual history identifies the mysterious second printer of the quarto; the stage history reviews all significant performances of either version and corrects the received record.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780393900880","urn:ISBN:9780300015126","urn:ISBN:9780393900156","urn:ISBN:9780713643978","urn:ISBN:9780413405401","urn:ISBN:9780713630251","urn:ISBN:9780510336363","urn:ISBN:9780719015656","urn:ISBN:9781171851264"],"id":66890,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=GLKrQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/20918/?feed=opds","author":"Ben Jonson","isOwn":false},{"category":["Authors, Canadian (English)","Canadian Novelists","Children's literature, English","City and town life -- Fiction","Country life -- Fiction","Fiction","GITenberg","Islands -- Fiction","Orphans -- Fiction","OverDrive","Prince Edward Island -- Fiction","PS","PZ","Shirley, Anne (Fictitious character) -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-11-10T15:24:25","language":"en","title":"Further Chronicles of Avonlea","issued":"1970-2010","summary":"Max always blesses the animal when it is referred to; and I don't deny that things have worked together for good after all.

It was impossible to behold him without imagination placing him in some strange crisis where religious zeal was the ruling principle.

They were debating what form a second edition of the Lyrical Ballads should take to replace the exhausted edition of 1798. In the course of a walk the idea of replacing the brief Advertisement by a critical Preface was conceived. In the aged memory of Wordsworth many years after, the idea and indeed the very substance of the Preface as he came to write it were all Coleridge's. 'I have never cared a straw about the theory,' he wrote impatiently on the manuscript of Barron Fields biography of him, 'and the Preface was written at the request of Mr. Coleridge out of sheer good nature. I recollect the very spot, a deserted quarry in the Vale of Grasmere, where he pressed the thing upon me, and but for that it would never have been thought of.' By 1815, of course, when he came to write the Biographia, the Preface was 'Wordsworth' and the Biographia Coleridge's reply to Wordsworth but the simplification is much too crude. It poses and tries to answer two closely connected questions: first, what relation should the language of poetry bear to that of ordinary life? And secondly, what relation should the subject of poetry bear to itself? (The order in which the questions are put look irrational, but it is Wordsworth's own order and there are good reasons for it.) The answers of the Preface are 'the real language of men in a state of vivid sensation' and 'the incidents of common life.' These two questions, or rather Coleridge's attempt to modify and clarify the old answers to them, are together the central theme of the second half of the Biographia.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780460873321","urn:ISBN:9780691018614","urn:ISBN:9780460871082","urn:ISBN:9780460000116","urn:ISBN:9780460100113","urn:ISBN:9780691098746","urn:ISBN:9781604245349","urn:ISBN:9781421269436","urn:ISBN:9781419110009"],"id":66916,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=u9p5PwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23130/?feed=opds","author":"Samuel Taylor Coleridge","isOwn":false},{"category":[" 20th century","Accessible book","Classic Literature","Fiction","GITenberg","Literature","OverDrive","Protected DAISY","PS","Short stories","Social life and customs","United States -- Social life and customs -- 20th century -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-07-27T16:38:37","language":"en","title":"Tales of the Jazz Age","issued":"1922-2012","summary":"Often overshadowed by his major novels, Fitzgerald's short stories demonstrate the same originality and inventive range, as he chronicles with wry and astute observation the temper of the hedonistic 1920s.

The collection also highlights Fitzgerald's ability to work in a variety of forms--parody, a one-act play, fantasy--with unrivalled versatility. Fitzgerald scholar Jackson R.

The volume also includes an up-to-date bibliography, a chronology of the author's life and work, and explanatory notes identifying contemporary references and allusions.","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9780812218558","urn:ISBN:9780141180489","urn:ISBN:9780811213332","urn:ISBN:9781594120848","urn:ISBN:9781603550994","urn:ISBN:9780521402385","urn:ISBN:9781177757409","urn:ISBN:9781604442588","urn:ISBN:9780307476371"],"id":66943,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=EGH9YfKL8vEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4666/?feed=opds","author":"Francis Scott Fitzgerald","isOwn":false},{"category":["History","Nonfiction","Social conditions"],"updated":"2013-11-27T22:00:34","language":"en","title":"Twelve Years a Slave","issued":"1855","summary":"","id":128222,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=61kSAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1004/?feed=opds","author":"Solomon Northup","isOwn":false},{"category":["Nonfiction","Religion"],"updated":"2013-11-30T10:20:26","language":"en","title":"Spiritual Energies in Daily Life","issued":"1922","summary":"","id":128476,"image":"https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=k1kXAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1009/?feed=opds","author":"Rufus Matthew Jones","isOwn":false},{"category":["Economic policy","Economics","Nonfiction","Politics and government","Social conditions"],"updated":"2014-05-29T22:53:30","language":"en","title":"Democratic Wealth: Building a Citizens' Economy","issued":"2014","summary":"'Democratic Wealth: Building a Citizens' Economy'' is a collection of essays that challenges the poverty of thinking around economic policy, particularly after the 2007 financial crash.

In the third, Republican Politics, contributors including Quentin Skinner, Alex Gourevitch and Karma Nabulsi discuss the politics of republicanism, from challenging  the surveillance state to democratising the workplace and harnessing the demands of new social movements for freedom from domination by the one per cent. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n‘...as regards wealth, ... no citizen should be rich enough to be able to buy another, and none so poor that he has to sell himself...’ -  Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Social Contract","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781310534980"],"id":137320,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/c0/6c/c06c22679d8007bb8c37ea426be192a1.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/1283/?feed=opds","author":"openDemocracy - Politics in Spires","isOwn":false},{"category":["Nonfiction"],"updated":"2014-06-02T11:46:13","language":"en","title":"Solitudes and Silence","issued":"2011","summary":"“Solitudes and Silence” is the story of Waimbrill, a soulcleaver, a beloved outcast, respected yet feared among his countrymen.

The history of fungal infections does not fit this picture; indeed, it runs against it - this book charts the path of fungal infections from the mid nineteenth century to the dawn of the twenty-first century, both in Britain and the United States. It examines how fungal infections became more prevalent and serious over the century, a rise that was linked to the increased incidence of chronic diseases and to social, technological and medical 'progress'. In 1900, conditions such as ringworm, athlete's foot and thrush were minor, external and mostly chronic conditions – irritating, but mostly self-limiting. In the subsequent decades, these infections remained very common, but were better controlled by antifungal drugs. However, by the year 2000 doctors were faced by a growing number of serious and life-threatening fungal infections, such as invasive aspergillosis and systemic candidiasis. These infections principally affect patients who have benefited from medical advances, such as antibiotic treatment and transplantation, and those with immuno-compromised conditions.\r\n<br /><br /> Print editions available via <a href=\"http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/fungal-disease-in-britain-and-the-united-states-18502000-aya-homei/?isb=9781137377012\">Palgrave Macmillan</a>","identifers":["urn:ISBN:9781137377036","urn:ISBN:9781137377012","urn:ISBN:9781137377029","urn:ISBN:9781137392633"],"id":151341,"image":"https://eric-unglueit.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/43/f4/43f4fbf3c0dc5b7df63d6e1df52ca53d.jpg","download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/3015/?feed=opds","author":"Aya Homei","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fantasy fiction","Fiction","Fiction / Science Fiction","Wizards"],"updated":"2015-11-14T00:42:05","language":"en","title":"Spell of Apocalypse","issued":"1994-2011","summary":"<p>\r\n\tWhen the Great Karlini’s laboratory catches on fire, Maximillian the Vaguely Disreputable knows it’s a sign of bad things to come.

of Sara Crewe now told for the first time","issued":"1994","summary":"A Little Princess is a children's novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, first published as a book in 1905. It is an expanded version of the short story Sara Crewe: or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's, which was serialized in St. Nicholas Magazine from December 1887. According to Burnett, after she composed the 1902 play A Little Un-fairy Princess based on that story, her publisher asked that she expand the story as a novel with &quot;the things and people that had been left out before&quot;. The novel was published by Charles Scribner's Sons (also publisher of St. Nicholas) with illustrations by Ethel Franklin Betts and the full title A Little Princess: Being the Whole Story of Sara Crewe Now Being Told for the First Time.\nBased on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association named the book one of its &quot;Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. In 2012 it was ranked number 56 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. It was the second of two Burnett novels among the Top 100, with The Secret Garden number 15.\n From Wikipedia (CC

She began it soon after she had finished Emma and completed it in August 1816. Persuasion was published in December 1817, but is dated 1818. The author died earlier in 1817.\nAs the Napoleonic Wars come to an end in 1814, Admirals and Captains of the Royal Navy are put ashore, their work done. Anne Elliot meets Captain Frederick Wentworth after seven years, by the chance of his sister and brother-in-law renting her father's estate, while she stays for a few months with her married sister, living nearby. They fell in love the first time, but she broke off the engagement.\nBesides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics, with which Austen was familiar: the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen's brothers rose to the rank of admiral; and the superficial social life of Bath. It is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of Persuasion. In many respects, Persuasion marks a break with Austen's previous works, both in the more biting, even irritable satire directed at some of the novel's characters and in the regretful, resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine, Anne Elliot, in the first part of the story. Against this is set the energy and appeal of the Royal Navy, which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of a more outgoing, engaged, and fulfilling life, and it is this worldview which triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel.\nPersuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from 1801 to 1805.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185259,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4678/?feed=opds","author":"Jane Austen","isOwn":true},{"category":["Adam (Biblical figure) -- Poetry","Bible.

M. Barrie's most famous work, in the form of a 1904 play and a 1911 novel. Both versions tell the story of Peter Pan, a mischievous yet innocent little boy who can fly, and has many adventures on the island of Neverland that is inhabited by mermaids, fairies, Native Americans and pirates. Peter has many stories involving Wendy Darling and her two brothers, his fairy Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys, and the pirate Captain Hook. The play and novel were inspired by Barrie's friendship with the Llewelyn Davies family. Barrie continued to revise the play for years after its debut until publication of the play script in 1928.\nThe play debuted in London on 27 December 1904 with Nina Boucicault, daughter of playwright Dion Boucicault, in the title role. A Broadway production was mounted in 1905 starring Maude Adams. It was later revived with such actresses as Marilyn Miller and Eva Le Gallienne. The play has since been adapted as a pantomime, stage musical, a television special, and several films, including a 1924 silent film, Disney's 1953 animated full-length feature film, and a 2003 live action production. The play is now rarely performed in its original form on stage in the United Kingdom, whereas pantomime adaptations are frequently staged around Christmas. In the U.S., the original version has also been supplanted in popularity by the 1954 musical version, which became popular on television.\nThe novel was first published in 1911 by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in the United Kingdom and Charles Scribner's Sons in the United States. The original book contains a frontispiece and 11 half-tone plates by artist F. D. Bedford (whose illustrations are still under copyright in the EU). The novel was first abridged by May Byron in 1915, with Barrie's permission, and published under the title Peter Pan and Wendy, the first time this form was used. This version was later illustrated by Mabel Lucie Attwell in 1921. In 1929, Barrie gave the copyright of the Peter Pan works to Great Ormond Street Hospital, a children's hospital in London.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185480,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4871/?feed=opds","author":"J.

Its full name is Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences (French title: Discours de la méthode pour bien conduire sa raison, et chercher la vérité dans les sciences). The Discourse on The Method is best known as the source of the famous quotation &quot;Je pense, donc je suis&quot; (&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;), which occurs in Part IV of the work. (The similar statement in Latin, Cogito ergo sum, is found in Part I, §7 of Principles of Philosophy.)\nThe Discourse on the Method is one of the most influential works in the history of modern philosophy, and important to the development of natural sciences. In this work, Descartes tackles the problem of skepticism, which had previously been studied by Sextus Empiricus, Al-Ghazali and Michel de Montaigne. Descartes modified it to account for a truth he found to be incontrovertible. Descartes started his line of reasoning by doubting everything, so as to assess the world from a fresh perspective, clear of any preconceived notions.\nThe book was originally published in Leiden in the Netherlands. Later, it was translated into Latin and published in 1656 in Amsterdam. The book was intended as an introduction to three works Dioptrique, Météores and Géométrie. La Géométrie contains Descartes' first introduction of the Cartesian coordinate system. That the text was written and published in French rather than Latin, which was the language in which philosophical and scientific texts were most frequently written and published (as were most of Descartes' other works), is worth noting.\nTogether with Meditations on First Philosophy (Meditationes de Prima Philosophia), Principles of Philosophy (Principia philosophiae) and Rules for the Direction of the Mind (Regulae ad directionem ingenii), it forms the base of the epistemology known as Cartesianism.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185499,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4940/?feed=opds","author":"René Descartes","isOwn":false},{"category":["Carter, John (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","Dejah Thoris (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","GITenberg","Mars (Planet) -- Fiction","Princesses -- Fiction","PS","Science Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-05T21:54:11","language":"en","title":"A Princess of Mars","issued":"1993","summary":"Barsoom series, volume 1","id":185500,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4949/?feed=opds","author":"Edgar Rice Burroughs","isOwn":false},{"category":["Arabs -- Folklore","Children's stories","Fairy tales","Folklore -- Arab countries","GITenberg","PZ"],"updated":"2016-08-05T21:54:13","language":"en","title":"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp","issued":"1993","summary":"","id":185501,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4952/?feed=opds","author":"Unknown","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Radio broadcasting","TK"],"updated":"2016-08-05T21:56:45","language":"en","title":"The Dawn of Amateur Radio in the U.K. and Greece: A Personal View","issued":"1993","summary":"","id":185502,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4961/?feed=opds","author":"Norman F.

However, his scenario turned out to be impractical for safe manned space travel since a much longer muzzle would have been required to reach escape velocity while limiting acceleration to survivable limits for the passengers.\nThe character of Michel Ardan, the French member of the party in the novel, was inspired by the real-life photographer Félix Nadar.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185509,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4988/?feed=opds","author":"Jules Verne","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Mars (Planet) -- Fiction","Martians -- Fiction","PS","Science Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-05T22:06:39","language":"en","title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars","issued":"1993","summary":"Barsoom series, volume 4","id":185510,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/4991/?feed=opds","author":"Edgar Rice Burroughs","isOwn":false},{"category":["Americans -- Great Britain -- Fiction","Arthurian romances -- Adaptations","Britons -- Fiction","Fantasy fiction","GITenberg","Kings and rulers -- Fiction","Knights and knighthood -- Fiction","PS","Satire","Time travel -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-05T22:08:17","language":"en","title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","issued":"2004","summary":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an 1889 novel by the American humorist and writer Mark Twain.

The poem tells the story of a chase to recapture a valuable colt. 'The Man' - who is not identified by name - rides down a suicidally steep slope to rescue the horse, collect the reward money and become a local hero. It is thought that the character of The Man from Snowy River was based on Jack Riley from Corryong, although a strong case has been made that 'the Man' is a composite character from a number of people Paterson met. The poem was written at a time when there was a groundswell of sentiment towards Australia as a new and distinct nation apart from the British Empire, and the bush settings and characters in poems by Paterson and Henry Lawson served to emphasise the growing 'difference' in national identity. Several films, a television series and a musical have been made from the story, proof of its enduring power to captivate Australia ns to this day.","id":185542,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5126/?feed=opds","author":"A.

It continues with anecdotes of Twain's training as a steamboat pilot, as the 'cub' (apprentice) of an experienced pilot, Horace E. Bixby. He describes, with great affection, the science of navigating the ever-changing Mississippi River in a section that was first published in 1876, entitled &quot;Old Times on the Mississippi&quot;. Although Twain was actually 21 when he began his training, he uses artistic license to make himself seem somewhat younger, referring to himself as a &quot;fledgling&quot; and a &quot;boy&quot; who &quot;ran away from home&quot; to seek his fortune on the river, and playing up his own callowness and naïveté.\nIn the second half, Twain narrates his trip many years later on a steamboat from St. Louis to New Orleans. He describes the competition from railroads, and the new, large cities, and adds his observations on greed, gullibility, tragedy, and bad architecture. He also tells some stories that are most likely tall tales.\nSimultaneously published in 1883 in the United States and Great Britain, the book is the first submitted to a publisher as a typewritten manuscript.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185566,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5219/?feed=opds","author":"Mark Twain","isOwn":false},{"category":["Computer networks -- United States -- History","Internet -- History","TK"],"updated":"2016-08-05T23:23:05","language":"en","title":"A Brief History of the Internet The Bright Side: The Dark Side","issued":"1995","summary":"","id":185567,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5222/?feed=opds","author":"Michael Hart","isOwn":false},{"category":["AG","English language -- Dictionaries","GITenberg","PE"],"updated":"2016-08-05T23:23:10","language":"en","title":"Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (1st 100 Pages)","issued":"1995","summary":"1st 100 Pages","id":185568,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5225/?feed=opds","author":"Noah Webster","isOwn":false},{"category":["Art, Prehistoric -- France -- Vallon-Pont-d'Arc","Cave paintings -- France -- Vallon-Pont-d'Arc","Chauvet Cave (France)","N"],"updated":"2016-08-05T23:23:20","language":"en","title":"French Cave Paintings","issued":"1995","summary":"","id":185569,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5228/?feed=opds","author":"","isOwn":false},{"category":["AG","English language -- Dictionaries","GITenberg","PE"],"updated":"2016-08-05T23:23:38","language":"en","title":"Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (2nd 100 Pages)","issued":"1995","summary":"2nd 100 Pages","id":185570,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5231/?feed=opds","author":"Noah Webster","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","JK","United States.

J. Cutcliffe Hyne. It is considered one of the classic fictional retellings of the story of the drowning of Atlantis, combining elements of the myth told by Plato with the earlier Greek myth concerning the survival of a universal flood and restoration of the human race by Deucalion.\nThe novel was published first in serial form in Pearson's Magazine in the issues for July–December 1899, and in hardcover book form by Hutchinson (London) and Harpers (New York) in 1900. There have been several editions since. Its importance in the history of fantasy literature was recognized by its reissuing by Ballantine Books as the forty-second volume of the celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series during February 1972. Subsequent editions were issued by Oswald Train in 1974 and by Bison Books in 2002. The Ballantine edition includes an introduction by Lin Carter, and the Bison edition one by Harry Turtledove. The novel was also reprinted (somewhat abridged) in the magazine Famous Fantastic Mysteries (Dec. 1944), and in the anthology Science Fiction by the Rivals of H. G. Wells by Castle Books in 1979.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185597,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5318/?feed=opds","author":"Charles John Cutcliffe Wright Hyne","isOwn":false},{"category":["Americans -- France -- Fiction","Domestic fiction","France -- Fiction","GITenberg","Love stories","Man-woman relationships -- Fiction","PS"],"updated":"2016-08-06T00:53:14","language":"en","title":"The Reef","issued":"1995","summary":"The Reef is a 1912 novel by American writer Edith Wharton.

The book is told somewhat chronologically, though without sections or chapter headings.\nPresented as an eyewitness account of the events at the time, it was written in the years just prior to the book's first publication in March 1722. Defoe was only five years old in 1665, and the book itself was published under the initials H. F. and is probably based on the journals of Defoe's uncle, Henry Foe.\nIn the book, Defoe goes to great pains to achieve an effect of verisimilitude, identifying specific neighborhoods, streets, and even houses in which events took place. Additionally, it provides tables of casualty figures and discusses the credibility of various accounts and anecdotes received by the narrator.\nThe novel is often compared to the actual, contemporary accounts of the plague in the diary of Samuel Pepys. Defoe's account, which appears to include much research, is far more systematic and detailed than Pepys's first-person account.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185630,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5426/?feed=opds","author":"Daniel Defoe","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Prisoners -- Fiction","PS","Short stories","United States -- History -- Civil War, 1861-1865 -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T01:47:57","language":"en","title":"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge","issued":"1995","summary":"&quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot; or &quot;A Dead Man's Dream&quot; is a short story by American author Ambrose Bierce.

The story, which is set during the Civil War, is famous for its irregular time sequence and twist ending.

It was first published in 1916 as a serial in New York's Metropolitan Magazine (September—October) in the English Review (September 1916-March 1917) and published in book form in 1917 in the UK (March) and America (April). The novella depicts the development of a young man upon taking a captaincy in the Orient, with the shadow line of the title representing the threshold of this development.\nThe novella is notable for its dual narrative structure. The full, subtitled title of the novel is The Shadow-Line, A Confession, which immediately alerts the reader to the retrospective nature of the novella. The ironic constructions following from the conflict between the 'young' protagonist (who is never named) and the 'old' drive much of the underlying points of the novella, namely the nature of wisdom, experience and maturity. Conrad also extensively uses irony by comparison in the work, with characters such as Captain Giles and the ship's 'factotum' Ransome used to emphasise strengths and weaknesses of the protagonist.\nThe novella has often been cited as a metaphor of the First World War, given its timing and references to a long struggle, the importance of camaraderie, etc. This viewpoint may also be reinforced by the knowledge that Conrad's elder son, Borys, was wounded in the First World War. Others however see the novel as having a strong supernatural influence, referring to various plot-lines in the novella such as the 'ghost' of the previous captain potentially cursing the ship, and the madness of first mate Mr Burns. Conrad himself, however, denied this link in his 'Author's Note' (1920), claiming that although critics had attempted to show this link, &quot;The world of the living contains enough marvels and mysteries as it is.&quot;\nAndrzej Wajda has made a 1976 film adaptation of the novel under its Polish title - Smuga cienia.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185692,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5630/?feed=opds","author":"Joseph Conrad","isOwn":false},{"category":["England -- Fiction","GITenberg","PR","Romanies -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T02:28:40","language":"en","title":"Lavengro: The Scholar, the Gypsy, the Priest","issued":"1996","summary":"","id":185693,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5633/?feed=opds","author":"George Borrow","isOwn":false},{"category":["Businesswomen -- Fiction","GITenberg","McChesney, Emma (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","PS","Short stories","Traveling sales personnel -- Fiction","Women sales personnel -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T02:30:26","language":"en","title":"Emma McChesney and Co.","issued":"1996","summary":"","id":185694,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5636/?feed=opds","author":"Edna Ferber","isOwn":false},{"category":["BJ","Character","Conduct of life","GITenberg","Success"],"updated":"2016-08-06T02:30:33","language":"en","title":"The University of Hard Knocks","issued":"1996","summary":"","id":185695,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5639/?feed=opds","author":"Ralph Albert Parlette","isOwn":false},{"category":["Dialect literature, American","German Americans -- Poetry","Humorous poetry, American","PS","Wit and humor"],"updated":"2016-08-06T02:30:38","language":"en","title":"The Breitmann Ballads","issued":"1996","summary":"","id":185696,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5642/?feed=opds","author":"Charles Godfrey Leland","isOwn":false},{"category":["BF","Criminal psychology","Swindlers and swindling"],"updated":"2016-08-06T02:30:39","language":"en","title":"Pathology of Lying, Accusation, and Swindling: A Study in Forensic Psychology","issued":"1996","summary":"","id":185697,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5645/?feed=opds","author":"Mary Tenney Healy","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fantasy fiction, English","GITenberg","PR","Science fiction, English","Short stories"],"updated":"2016-08-06T02:31:07","language":"en","title":"The Door in the Wall, and Other Stories","issued":"1996","summary":"Widely recognized as one of the key figures in the development of the science fiction and fantasy genres, H.G.

Like an impressionist painter, Crane also captures the strange beauty of war: the brilliant red flags against a blue sky, steel bayonets flashing in the morning sun as soldiers step off into battle. In the midst of this chaotic outer world, he creates an intricate inner world as he takes us inside the head of Henry Fleming.","id":185708,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5666/?feed=opds","author":"Stephen Crane","isOwn":false},{"category":["Conduct of life -- Juvenile fiction","Diligence -- Juvenile fiction","Fathers and sons -- Juvenile fiction","GITenberg","Impostors and imposture -- Juvenile fiction","Inheritance and succession -- Juvenile fiction","New York (N.Y.) -- History -- 1865-1898 -- Juvenile fiction","Orphans -- Juvenile fiction","PS","PZ","Self-reliance -- Juvenile fiction","Stepmothers -- Juvenile fiction","Street life -- Juvenile fiction","Success -- Juvenile fiction","Youth -- Conduct of life -- Juvenile fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T15:25:13","language":"en","title":"The Errand Boy; Or, How Phil Brent Won Success","issued":"2006","summary":"","id":185709,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5669/?feed=opds","author":"Horatio Alger","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Oceania -- Description and travel","Polynesia -- Description and travel","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-06T15:26:52","language":"en","title":"In the South Seas Being an Account of Experiences and Observations in the Marquesas, Paumotus and Gilbert Islands in the Course of Two Cruises on the Yacht \"Casco\" (1888) and the Schooner \"Equator\" (1889)","issued":"1996","summary":"In the South Seas is a collection of Robert Louis Stevenson's articles and essays on his travels in the Pacific.

The novel is set in the Lammermuir Hills of south-east Scotland, and tells of a tragic love affair between young Lucy Ashton and her family's enemy Edgar Ravenswood. Scott indicated the plot was based on an actual incident. The Bride of Lammermoor and A Legend of Montrose were published together as the third of Scott's Tales of My Landlord series. As with all the Waverley Novels, The Bride of Lammermuir was published anonymously. The novel claims that the story was an oral tradition, collected by one &quot;Peter Pattieson&quot;, and subsequently published by &quot;Jedediah Cleishbotham&quot;. The 1830 &quot;Waverley edition&quot; includes an introduction by Scott, discussing his actual sources. The later edition also changes the date of the events: the first edition sets the story in the 17th century; the 1830 edition sets it in the reign of Queen Anne, after the 1707 Acts of Union which joined Scotland and England. The story is the basis for Donizetti's 1835 opera Lucia di Lammermoor.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185718,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5696/?feed=opds","author":"Walter Scott","isOwn":false},{"category":["African American women -- Fiction","African Americans -- Fiction","Didactic fiction","Domestic fiction","GITenberg","Passing (Identity) -- Fiction","PS","Psychological fiction","Racially mixed people -- Fiction","Racism -- Fiction","Southern States -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T15:30:42","language":"en","title":"The House Behind the Cedars","issued":"1996","summary":"Although he appeared to most observers to be white, American author Charles Waddell Chestnutt had some African-American ancestry and thus was subjected to the limited opportunities, discrimination, and segregated living conditions that faced African-Americans in the United States throughout his life.

In the story, the young Prince Dolor, whose legs are paralysed due to a childhood trauma, is exiled to a tower in a wasteland. As he grows older, a fairy godmother provides a magical travelling cloak so he can see, but not touch, the world. He uses this cloak to go on various adventures, and develops great wisdom and empathy in the process. Finally he becomes a wise and compassionate ruler of his own land.\nThe author's style was to stimulate positive feelings in her young readers so that they would be motivated to adopt socially correct actions in whatever circumstances they encountered. She shows how imagination (mediated by the cloak) can lead to empathy and enlightened morality. However, some critics have found a deeper theme in this story, relating to the restricted lives of respectable middle-class British Victorian women that enforced helplessness.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185737,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5765/?feed=opds","author":"Dinah Maria Mulock Craik","isOwn":false},{"category":["Calamity Jane, 1852-1903","Cowgirls -- West (U.S.) -- Biography","F590.3","GITenberg","Missouri -- History","Women -- West (U.S.) -- Biography"],"updated":"2016-08-06T17:10:12","language":"en","title":"Life and Adventures of Calamity Jane","issued":"1996","summary":"","id":185738,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/5768/?feed=opds","author":"Calamity Jane","isOwn":false},{"category":["Coke, Henry J.

In his book Henry James (1913), Ford Madox Ford wrote that after the nouvelle was published, James’ contemporaries had set themselves on a quest to locate the Figure as an identifiable physical entity. In the preface to his Choice of Kipling’s Verse (1941), T.S.

His American journey was also an inspiration for his novel Martin Chuzzlewit. Having arrived in Boston, he visited Lowell, New York, and Philadelphia, and travelled as far south as Richmond, as far west as St. Louis and as far north as Quebec. The American city he liked best was Boston – &quot;the air was so clear, the houses were so bright and gay. [...] The city is a beautiful one, and cannot fail, I should imagine, to impress all strangers very favourably.&quot; Further, it was close to the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind where Dickens encountered Laura Bridgman, who impressed him greatly.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185874,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6236/?feed=opds","author":"Charles Dickens","isOwn":false},{"category":["English language -- Dictionaries","PE"],"updated":"2016-08-06T19:08:32","language":"en","title":"The Gutenberg Webster's Unabridged Dictionary Section M, N, and O","issued":"1996","summary":"Section M, N, and O","id":185875,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6239/?feed=opds","author":"Noah Webster","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Mythology, Greek -- Juvenile literature","PZ"],"updated":"2016-08-06T19:10:28","language":"en","title":"The Heroes; Or, Greek Fairy Tales for My Children","issued":"1996","summary":"","id":185876,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6242/?feed=opds","author":"Charles Kingsley","isOwn":false},{"category":["DE","Greece -- Biography -- Early works to 1800","Rome -- Biography -- Early works to 1800"],"updated":"2016-08-06T19:10:41","language":"en","title":"Plutarch: Lives of the noble Grecians and Romans","issued":"1996","summary":"","id":185877,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6245/?feed=opds","author":"Plutarch","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Poetry","PS"],"updated":"2016-08-06T19:12:41","language":"en","title":"Poems","issued":"1996","summary":"","id":185878,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6251/?feed=opds","author":"Frances Ellen Watkins Harper","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Indic poetry (English)","PK"],"updated":"2016-08-06T19:13:18","language":"en","title":"The Golden Threshold","issued":"1996","summary":"","id":185879,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6254/?feed=opds","author":"Sarojini Naidu","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","GITenberg","PG"],"updated":"2016-08-06T19:13:20","language":"en","title":"Creatures That Once Were Men","issued":"1996","summary":"","id":185880,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6257/?feed=opds","author":"Maksim Gorky","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Nuclear warfare -- Environmental aspects","Radioactive fallout","UF"],"updated":"2016-08-06T19:15:48","language":"en","title":"Worldwide Effects of Nuclear War: Some Perspectives","issued":"1996","summary":"","id":185881,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6260/?feed=opds","author":"United States.

Hornung featuring his most famous character, A. J. Raffles, a gentleman thief in late Victorian Great Britain. It was first published in 1899. The book was very well received and spawned three follow-ups: two more short story collections, The Black Mask (1901) and A Thief in the Night (1904), as well as a full-length novel, Mr. Justice Raffles in 1909.\nArthur Raffles is a prominent member of London society, and a national sporting hero. As a cricketer he regularly represents England in Test matches. He uses this as a chance to commit a number of burglaries, primarily stealing valuable jewelry from his hosts. In this he is assisted by his friend, the younger, idealistic Bunny Manders. Both men are constantly under the surveillance of Inspector Mackenzie of Scotland Yard who is always thwarted in his attempts to pin the crimes on Raffles.\nIn the final story, &quot;The Gift of the Emperor&quot;, Raffles is called into service on behalf of the Foreign Office who wish to recover a valuable pearl from a German diplomat staying in England. However, this is only in the TV adaptation; in the book he is working entirely for his own profit.\nThe short stories included in the collection are:\n&quot;The Ides of March&quot;\n&quot;A Costume Piece&quot;\n&quot;Gentlemen and Players&quot;\n&quot;Le Premier Pas&quot;\n&quot;Wilful Murder&quot;\n&quot;Nine Points of the Law&quot;\n&quot;The Return Match&quot;\n&quot;The Gift of the Emperor&quot;\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185899,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6323/?feed=opds","author":"E.

The play was first published in 1893. Like many of Wilde's comedies, it bitingly satirizes the morals of society.\nThe story concerns Lady Windermere, who suspects that her husband is having an affair with another woman. She confronts him with it but although he denies it, he invites the other woman, Mrs Erlynne, to his wife's birthday ball. Angered by her husband's supposed unfaithfulness, Lady Windermere decides to leave her husband for another lover. After discovering what has transpired, Mrs Erlynne follows Lady Windermere and attempts to persuade her to return to her husband and in the course of this, Mrs Erlynne is discovered in a compromising position. It is then revealed Mrs Erlynne is Lady Windermere's mother, who abandoned her family twenty years before the time the play is set. Mrs Erlynne sacrifices herself and her reputation to save her daughter's marriage. The best known line of the play sums up the central theme:\n\nWe are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185964,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6545/?feed=opds","author":"Oscar Wilde","isOwn":false},{"category":["English poetry -- 19th century","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-06T20:19:17","language":"en","title":"The Princess","issued":"1997","summary":"","id":185965,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6548/?feed=opds","author":"Alfred Tennyson Tennyson, Baron","isOwn":false},{"category":["Brothers and sisters -- Fiction","Combustion, Spontaneous -- Fiction","Epistolary fiction","Fathers -- Death -- Fiction","GITenberg","Gothic fiction (Literary genre)","Horror tales","Pennsylvania -- History -- Colonial period, ca. 1600-1775 -- Fiction","PS","Psychological fiction","Radicals -- Fiction","Religious fanaticism -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-06T20:19:31","language":"en","title":"Wieland; Or, The Transformation: An American Tale","issued":"1997","summary":"Wieland: or, The Transformation: An American Tale, usually simply called Wieland, is the first major work by Charles Brockden Brown.

In 1765, Sterne travelled through France and Italy as far south as Naples, and after returning determined to describe his travels from a sentimental point of view. The novel can be seen as an epilogue to the possibly unfinished work The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, and also as an answer to Tobias Smollett's decidedly unsentimental Travels through France and Italy. Sterne had met Smollett during his travels in Europe, and strongly objected to his spleen, acerbity and quarrelsomeness. He modeled the character of Smelfungus on him.\nThe novel was extremely popular and influential and helped establish travel writing as the dominant genre of the second half of the 18th century. Unlike prior travel accounts which stressed classical learning and objective non-personal points of view, A Sentimental Journey emphasized the subjective discussions of personal taste and sentiments, of manners and morals over classical learning. Throughout the 1770s female travel writers began publishing significant numbers of sentimental travel accounts. Sentiment also became a favorite style among those expressing non-mainstream views including political radicalism.\nThe narrator is the Reverend Mr. Yorick, who is slyly represented to guileless readers as Sterne's barely disguised alter ego. The book recounts his various adventures, usually of the amorous type, in a series of self-contained episodes. The book is less eccentric and more elegant in style than Tristram Shandy and was better received by contemporary critics. It was published on 27 February, and on 18 March Sterne died.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":185976,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6581/?feed=opds","author":"Laurence Sterne","isOwn":false},{"category":["Detective and mystery stories, English","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-06T20:29:27","language":"en","title":"Hunted Down: The Detective Stories of Charles Dickens","issued":"1997","summary":"Charles Dickens was one of the great pioneers of detective fiction.

It is one of the earliest American realist works, and is an important text for those who study labor and women's issues. It was immediately recognized as an innovative work, and introduced American readers to &quot;the bleak lives of industrial workers in the mills and factories of the nation.&quot;\nLife in the Iron Mills was initially published in The Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 0007, Issue 42 in April 1861. After being published anonymously, both Emily Dickinson and Nathaniel Hawthorne praised the work. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward was also greatly influenced by Davis's Life in the Iron Mills and in 1868 published in The Atlantic Monthly &quot;The Tenth of January,&quot; based on the 1860 fire at the Pemberton Mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts.\nRebecca Harding Davis was considered one of the nation's first social historians and pioneering literary artists. She wrote to find social change for blacks, women, immigrants, and the working class throughout the Civil War. Throughout her long career, Davis challenged traditional subjects and older styles of writing. Her family lived briefly in Big Springs, Alabama, before moving in 1837 to Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), on the Ohio River. Its iron mills and immigrant populations inspired the setting of Life in the Iron Mills.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186058,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6776/?feed=opds","author":"Rebecca Harding Davis","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","PS","Tramps -- New England"],"updated":"2016-08-07T19:16:57","language":"en","title":"Yankee Gypsies","issued":"1997","summary":"","id":186059,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6779/?feed=opds","author":"John Greenleaf Whittier","isOwn":false},{"category":["English drama -- 19th century","Padua (Italy) -- Drama","PR","Revenge -- Drama","Tragedies"],"updated":"2016-08-07T19:16:58","language":"en","title":"The Duchess of Padua","issued":"1997","summary":"'The Duchess of Padua', written in 1883, is a tragic melodrama that centres around a young man named Guido Ferranti who has come to Padua to learn the secret of his birth.

The persona sits well with a writer who liked to travel, not only as a tourist, but also to research and report what he found; visiting Europe, America and giving book readings throughout Britain. He does not seem content to rest late in his career when he had attained wealth and comfort and continued travelling locally, walking the streets of London in the mould of the flâneur, a 'gentleman stroller of city streets'. He often suffered from insomnia and his night-time wanderings gave him an insight into some of the hidden aspects of Victorian London, details of which he also incorporated into his novels.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186107,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6887/?feed=opds","author":"Charles Dickens","isOwn":false},{"category":["Children's libraries -- United States","Z"],"updated":"2016-08-08T13:38:43","language":"en","title":"Library Work with Children","issued":"1997","summary":"","id":186108,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/6890/?feed=opds","author":"Alice Isabel Hazeltine","isOwn":false},{"category":["Boone, Daniel, 1734-1820","F396","GITenberg","Indian captivities -- Kentucky","Kentucky -- History -- To 1792","Pioneers -- Kentucky -- Biography"],"updated":"2016-08-08T13:38:52","language":"en","title":"The Adventures of Col.

It had originally been planned to appear as his first, but changes of publisher led to many delays, and it first appeared in serial form in the Clock from February to November 1841.\nIt was Dickens' first historical novel. His only other is the much later A Tale of Two Cities, also set in revolutionary times. It is one of his less popular novels and has rarely been adapted for film or television.

Frank Baum. Published on June 20, 1916, with full-color and black-and-white illustrations by artist John R. Neill, it is significant that no one from Oz appears in the book until its climax; this is due to Baum's having originally written most of the book as an original fantasy novel over ten years earlier, in 1905. Most of the action takes place on three islands – Pingaree, Regos, and Coregos – and within the Nome King's caverns. Since the original ruler of the nomes, Roquat – who later renamed himself Ruggedo, was deposed in 1914's Tik-Tok of Oz, Baum had to cleverly rework the tale to accommodate his successor, the well-intentioned – but politically motivated – Kaliko.\nThe book was dedicated to the author's newborn grandson Robert Alison Baum, the first child of the author's second son Robert Stanton Baum.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186142,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7004/?feed=opds","author":"L.

It was originally serialised in 1843 and 1844. Dickens thought it to be his best work, but it was one of his least popular novels. Like nearly all of Dickens' novels, Martin Chuzzlewit was released to the public in monthly instalments. Early sales of the monthly parts were disappointing, compared to previous works, so Dickens changed the plot to send the title character to America. This allowed the author to portray the United States (which he had visited in 1842) satirically as a near wilderness with pockets of civilisation filled with deceptive and self-promoting hucksters.\nThe main theme of the novel, according to a preface by Dickens, is selfishness, portrayed in a satirical fashion using all the members of the Chuzzlewit family. The novel is also notable for two of Dickens' great villains, Seth Pecksniff and Jonas Chuzzlewit. It is dedicated to Angela Georgina Burdett-Coutts, a friend of Dickens.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186150,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7043/?feed=opds","author":"Charles Dickens","isOwn":false},{"category":["American wit and humor","GITenberg","PS","Short stories, American"],"updated":"2016-08-08T14:19:13","language":"en","title":"Uncle Josh's Punkin Centre Stories","issued":"1997","summary":"","id":186151,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7046/?feed=opds","author":"Cal Stewart","isOwn":false},{"category":["B","Ethics","GITenberg"],"updated":"2016-08-08T14:19:31","language":"en","title":"Ethics — Part 4","issued":"1997","summary":"","id":186152,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7049/?feed=opds","author":"Benedictus de Spinoza","isOwn":false},{"category":["Buccaneers -- Fiction","GITenberg","Historical fiction, American","Pirates -- Fiction","PS","Sea stories, American","Spanish Main -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-08T14:21:17","language":"en","title":"Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates Fiction, Fact & Fancy Concerning the Buccaneers & Marooners of the Spanish Main","issued":"2006","summary":"","id":186153,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7052/?feed=opds","author":"Howard Pyle","isOwn":false},{"category":["English language -- Dictionaries -- Humor","English language -- Semantics -- Humor","GITenberg","PS","Vocabulary -- Humor"],"updated":"2016-08-08T14:21:18","language":"en","title":"The Devil's Dictionary","issued":"1997","summary":"The Devil's Dictionary is a satirical dictionary written by American journalist and author Ambrose Bierce.

To evade contemporary prejudice against female writers, the Brontë sisters adopted masculine first names. All three retained the first letter of their first names: Charlotte became Currer Bell, Anne became Acton Bell, and Emily became Ellis Bell. The book was printed by Aylott and Jones, from London. The first edition failed to attract interest, with only two copies being sold. However, the sisters decided to continue writing for publication and began work on their first novels, which became commercial successes. Following the success of Charlotte's Jane Eyre in 1848, and after the deaths of Emily and Anne, the second edition of this book (printed in 1850 by Smith &amp; Elder) fared much better, with Charlotte's additions of previously unpublished poetry by her two late sisters.

Teufelsdröckh's Transcendentalist musings are mulled over by a skeptical English Reviewer (referred to as Editor) who also provides fragmentary biographical material on the philosopher.

The characters of the novel are supporters of the Spanish Pretender Carlos, Duke of Madrid. Curiously, the novel features a person referred to as &quot;Lord X&quot;, whose activities as arms smuggler resemble those of the Carlist politician Tirso de Olazábal y Lardizábal, Count of Arbelaiz.\nThe narrator of The Arrow of Gold has considerable involvement in the story and is unnamed, though some assume he is Conrad's regular narrator, Charles Marlow. The principal theme is a love triangle which comprises the young narrator, Doña Rita and the Confederate veteran Captain Blunt (named for Simon F. Blunt. Doña Rita finances the operations of the narrator's vessel, Tremolino which smuggles ammunition to the Carlist army. Nautical operations are detailed in the Tremolino chapters of The Mirror of the Sea rather than in this novel.\nConrad dedicated the novel to his friend and literary assistant Richard Curle.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186240,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7337/?feed=opds","author":"Joseph Conrad","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Hero worship","heroes","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-08T17:09:30","language":"en","title":"On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History","issued":"1997","summary":"","id":186241,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7340/?feed=opds","author":"Thomas Carlyle","isOwn":false},{"category":["English drama","GITenberg","Historical drama","PR","Timur, 1336-1405 -- Drama","Tragedies"],"updated":"2016-08-08T17:09:30","language":"en","title":"Tamburlaine the Great — Part 1","issued":"1997","summary":"","id":186242,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7343/?feed=opds","author":"Alexander Dyce (editor)","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","New Mexico -- Fiction","PS","Western stories","Women pioneers -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-08T17:10:55","language":"en","title":"The Light of the Western Stars","issued":"1997","summary":"From the moment Madeling Hammond steps off the train in New Mexico, she walks straight into trouble.

Set in Paris in 1819, it follows the intertwined lives of three characters: the elderly doting Goriot; a mysterious criminal-in-hiding named Vautrin; and a naive law student named Eugène de Rastignac.\nOriginally published in serial form during the winter of 1834/35, Le Père Goriot is widely considered Balzac's most important novel. It marks the first serious use by the author of characters who had appeared in other books, a technique that distinguishes Balzac's fiction. The novel is also noted as an example of his realist style, using minute details to create character and subtext.\nThe novel takes place during the Bourbon Restoration, which brought profound changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a major theme in the book. The city of Paris also impresses itself on the characters – especially young Rastignac, who grew up in the provinces of southern France. Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature of family and marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions.\nThe novel was released to mixed reviews. Some critics praised the author for his complex characters and attention to detail; others condemned him for his many depictions of corruption and greed. A favorite of Balzac's, the book quickly won widespread popularity and has often been adapted for film and the stage. It gave rise to the French expression &quot;Rastignac&quot;, a social climber willing to use any means to better his situation.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186326,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7610/?feed=opds","author":"Honoré de Balzac","isOwn":false},{"category":["English poetry","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-08T19:09:30","language":"en","title":"The City of Dreadful Night","issued":"1998","summary":"This long poem written by Scottish author James Thomson is a notable literary accomplishment on several levels.

Night and Day deals with issues concerning women's suffrage, if love and marriage can coexist, and if marriage is necessary for happiness.

The original edition, published by Hetzel, contains a number of illustrations by Jules Férat. The novel is a crossover sequel to Verne's famous Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and In Search of the Castaways, though its themes are vastly different from those books. An early draft of the novel, initially rejected by Verne's publisher and wholly reconceived before publication, was titled Shipwrecked Family: Marooned With Uncle Robinson, seen as indicating the influence on the novel of Robinson Crusoe and The Swiss Family Robinson. Verne developed a similar theme in his later novel, Godfrey Morgan (French: L'École des Robinsons, 1882).\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186349,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7685/?feed=opds","author":"Jules Verne","isOwn":false},{"category":["Didactic fiction","GITenberg","PR","Religion -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-08T19:29:29","language":"en","title":"The Soul of a Bishop","issued":"2006","summary":"The Soul of a Bishop is a 1917 novel by H.

It is set in Carthage during the 3rd century BC, immediately before and during the Mercenary Revolt which took place shortly after the First Punic War. Flaubert's main source was Book I of Polybius's Histories. It was not a particularly well-studied period of history and required a great deal of work from the author, who enthusiastically left behind the realism of his masterpiece Madame Bovary for this melodramatic, blood-soaked tale.\nThe book, which Flaubert researched painstakingly, is largely an exercise in sensuous and violent exoticism. Following the success of Madame Bovary, it was another best-seller and sealed his reputation. The Carthaginian costumes described in it even left traces on the fashions of the time. Nevertheless, in spite of its classic status in France, it is not widely known today among English speakers.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186364,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7737/?feed=opds","author":"Gustave Flaubert","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adventure and adventurers -- Juvenile fiction","Aeronautics -- Juvenile fiction","Airships -- Juvenile fiction","GITenberg","PZ","Swift, Tom (Fictitious character) -- Juvenile fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-08T19:40:04","language":"en","title":"Tom Swift and His Air Scout; Or, Uncle Sam's Mastery of the Sky","issued":"1998","summary":"","id":186365,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7740/?feed=opds","author":"Victor Appleton","isOwn":false},{"category":["French fiction -- Translations into English","GITenberg","PQ"],"updated":"2016-08-08T19:41:07","language":"en","title":"The Firm of Nucingen","issued":"1998","summary":"","id":186366,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7743/?feed=opds","author":"Honoré de Balzac","isOwn":false},{"category":["English essays","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-08T19:41:42","language":"en","title":"Ceres' Runaway, and Other Essays","issued":"1998","summary":"","id":186367,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/7746/?feed=opds","author":"Alice Meynell","isOwn":false},{"category":["Blue collar workers -- United States -- Biography","Davis, James J.

It was published in the Revue de Paris in 1834. In contrast with the realism of most of the author's best known works, the story delves into the fantastic and the supernatural to illustrate philosophical themes.\nIn a castle in Norway near the fjord Stromfjord, Séraphitüs, a strange and melancholic being, conceals a terrible secret. Séraphitüs loves Minna, and she returns this love, believing Séraphitüs to be a man. But Séraphitüs is also loved by Wilfrid, who considers Séraphitüs to be a woman (Séraphîta).\nIn reality, Séraphitüs-Séraphîta is a perfect androgyne, born to parents who by the doctrines of Emanuel Swedenborg have transcended their humanity, and Séraphitüs-Séraphîta is the perfect example of humanity.\nRuggero Leoncavallo wrote a symphonic poem based on the story.\nAn early drawing of Paul Gauguin's Oviri ceramic sculpture bears the inscription &quot;Et le monstre, entréignant sa créature, féconde de sa semence des flancs généreux pour engendrer Séraphitus-Séraphita&quot; (And the monster, embracing its creation, filled her generous womb with seed and fathered Séraphitus-Séraphita), referencing the novel.\nIn 2010–2011 Ouriel Zohar staged Seraphita, his adaptation with Barbara Heman, performed in Paris at the &quot;Theatre de l'Ile Saint-Louis&quot;, Brussels, Greece, and Republic of Congo. In 2012 he staged it in the Maison de Balzac, Paris, Haifa, Greece, Switzerland, Istanbul and &quot;Theatre Darius Milhaud&quot; in Paris. In 2014 his theater went to India with his 2 shows: &quot;Message to Materialistes&quot; and &quot;Seraphita&quot;.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186466,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8076/?feed=opds","author":"Honoré de Balzac","isOwn":false},{"category":["French fiction -- Translations into English","GITenberg","Historical fiction","PQ"],"updated":"2016-08-08T20:52:45","language":"en","title":"The Red Inn","issued":"2005","summary":"","id":186467,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8079/?feed=opds","author":"Honoré de Balzac","isOwn":false},{"category":["English essays","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-08T20:52:55","language":"en","title":"Essays","issued":"1998","summary":"","id":186468,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8082/?feed=opds","author":"Alice Meynell","isOwn":false},{"category":["DT","Ethiopia -- Description and travel -- Early works to 1800","GITenberg","Lobo, Jerónimo, 1596?-1678 -- Travel -- Ethiopia"],"updated":"2016-08-08T20:53:56","language":"en","title":"A Voyage to Abyssinia","issued":"1998","summary":"","id":186469,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8085/?feed=opds","author":"Henry Morley (editor)","isOwn":false},{"category":["French fiction -- Translations into English","GITenberg","PQ"],"updated":"2016-08-08T20:54:11","language":"en","title":"La Grenadiere","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":186470,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8088/?feed=opds","author":"Honoré de Balzac","isOwn":false},{"category":["French fiction -- Translations into English","GITenberg","Love stories","PQ"],"updated":"2016-08-08T20:55:14","language":"en","title":"Juana","issued":"1998","summary":"","id":186471,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8091/?feed=opds","author":"Honoré de Balzac","isOwn":false},{"category":["Dreams","GITenberg","PR","Women -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-08T20:55:44","language":"en","title":"Dreams","issued":"1998","summary":"","id":186472,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8094/?feed=opds","author":"Olive Schreiner","isOwn":false},{"category":["Africa, Southern -- Fiction","Bildungsromans","Farm life -- Fiction","Feminists -- Fiction","GITenberg","Historical fiction","PR","Young women -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-08T20:56:44","language":"en","title":"The Story of an African Farm","issued":"1998","summary":"Olive Schreiner's landmark novel, a South African classic, takes place in the rural Karoo towards the end of the 19th century.

Although the novel was not one upon which Conrad's later critical reputation was to depend, it was his greatest commercial success upon initial publication.\nChance is narrated by Conrad's regular narrator, Charles Marlow, but is characterised by a complex, nested narrative in which different narrators take up the story at different points. The novel is also unusual among its author's works for its focus on a female character: the heroine, Flora de Barral.\nThe narrators describe and attempt to interpret various episodes in the life of Miss de Barral, the daughter of a convicted swindler named Smith de Barral (though this character is famous in the world of the novel as a criminal, he may, at least at first, have been merely an incompetent banker). Miss de Barral leads a sheltered life while her father is prosperous, then must rely on the generosity of others, who resent her or have agendas for her, before she escapes by marrying one Captain Anthony. Much of the book involves the musing of the various narrators over what she and the Captain expected from this union, and what they actually got from it.

The story is set in the 1830s at Rugby School, a public school for boys. Hughes attended Rugby School from 1834 to 1842.\nThe novel was originally published as being &quot;by an Old Boy of Rugby&quot;, and much of it is based on the author's experiences. Tom Brown is largely based on the author's brother George Hughes. George Arthur, another of the book's main characters, is generally believed to be based on Arthur Penrhyn Stanley. The fictional Tom's life also resembles the author's, in that the culminating event of his school career was a cricket match. The novel also features Dr Thomas Arnold (1795–1842), who was the actual headmaster of Rugby School from 1828 to 1841.\nTom Brown's School Days has been the source for several film and television adaptations. It also influenced the genre of British school novels, which began in the 19th century, and led to fictional depictions of schools such as Billy Bunter's Greyfriars School, Mr Chips' Brookfield, St. Trinian's, and Harry Potter's Hogwarts. A sequel, Tom Brown at Oxford, was published in 1861.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186515,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8217/?feed=opds","author":"Thomas Hughes","isOwn":false},{"category":["French fiction -- Translations into English","GITenberg","PQ"],"updated":"2016-08-09T12:04:41","language":"en","title":"Modeste Mignon","issued":"1998","summary":"","id":186516,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8220/?feed=opds","author":"Honoré de Balzac","isOwn":false},{"category":["Ink","TP"],"updated":"2016-08-09T12:04:59","language":"en","title":"Forty Centuries of Ink Or, A chronological narrative concerning ink and its backgrounds, introducing incidental observations and deductions, parallels of time and color phenomena, bibliography, chemistry, poetical effusions, citations, anecdotes and curiosa together with some evidence respecting the evanescent character of most inks of to-day and an epitome of chemico-legal ink.","issued":"1998","summary":"","id":186517,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8223/?feed=opds","author":"David Nunes Carvalho","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","MT","Opera","Wagner, Richard, 1813-1883.

It is regarded as an important stage in the development of the modern genre of biography; many have claimed it as the greatest biography written in English, but some modern critics object that the work cannot be considered a proper biography. While Boswell's personal acquaintance with his subject only began in 1763, when Johnson was 54 years old, Boswell covered the entirety of Johnson's life by means of additional research. The biography takes many critical liberties with Johnson's life, as Boswell makes various changes to Johnson's quotations and even censors many comments. Nonetheless, modern biographers have found Boswell's biography an important source of information on Johnson and his times.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186594,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8460/?feed=opds","author":"Charles Grosvenor Osgood (editor)","isOwn":false},{"category":["Burglars -- Fiction","Detective and mystery stories","GITenberg","Lupin, Arsène (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","PQ"],"updated":"2016-08-09T17:11:22","language":"en","title":"The Crystal Stopper","issued":"1998","summary":"The Crystal Stopper is a mystery novel by Maurice Leblanc featuring the adventures of the gentleman thief Arsène Lupin.

The novel was inspired by the painting The Last Day of Pompeii by the Russian painter Karl Briullov, which Bulwer-Lytton had seen in Milan. It culminates in the cataclysmic destruction of the city of Pompeii by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.\nThe novel uses its characters to contrast the decadent culture of 1st-century Rome with both older cultures and coming trends. The protagonist, Glaucus, represents the Greeks who have been subordinated by Rome, and his nemesis Arbaces the still older culture of Egypt. Olinthus is the chief representative of the nascent Christian religion, which is presented favourably but not uncritically. The Witch of Vesuvius, though she has no supernatural powers, shows Bulwer-Lytton's interest in the occult – a theme which would emerge in his later writing, particularly The Coming Race.\nA popular sculpture by American sculptor Randolph Rogers, Nydia, the Blind Flower Girl of Pompeii (1856), was based on a character from the book.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186596,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8466/?feed=opds","author":"Edward Bulwer Lytton Lytton, Baron","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Medicine -- History","R"],"updated":"2016-08-09T17:13:07","language":"en","title":"The Evolution of Modern Medicine A Series of Lectures Delivered at Yale University on the Silliman Foundation in April, 1913","issued":"2006","summary":"","id":186597,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8469/?feed=opds","author":"William Osler","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Poetry","PS"],"updated":"2016-08-09T17:13:49","language":"en","title":"Poems","issued":"1998","summary":"","id":186598,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8472/?feed=opds","author":"T.

From criticism of the educational aims and methods of the sophists the dialogue broadens out to consider the nature of the good life, and the role of pleasure and intellect in the context of that life. The dialogue combines subtlety of argument with intricacy of dramatic construction and brilliant characterization.

It is attributed to Fernando de Rojas, a descendant of converted Jews, who practiced law and, later in life, served as an alderman of Talavera de la Reina, an important commercial center near Toledo.\nThe book is considered to be one of the greatest works of Spanish literature, and traditionally marks the end of medieval literature and the beginning of the literary renaissance in Spain. Although usually regarded as a novel, it is written as a continuous series of dialogues and can be taken as a play, having been staged as such and filmed.\nThe story tells of a bachelor Calisto who uses the old procuress Celestina to start an affair with Melibea, an unmarried girl kept in seclusion by her parents. Though the two use the rhetoric of courtly love, sex not marriage is their aim. When he dies in an accident, she commits suicide. The name Celestina has become synonymous with procuress, especially an older woman used to further an illicit affair, and is a literary archetype of this character, the masculine counterpart being Pandarus.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186646,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8622/?feed=opds","author":"Fernando de Rojas","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Ireland -- Drama","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-09T17:45:17","language":"en","title":"In the Shadow of the Glen","issued":"1999","summary":"Dan Burke, it seems, is dead, his body lying on his bed beneath a sheet.

Its popularity was immediate, and it was printed 745 times before 1650. Apart from the Bible, no book has been translated into more languages than the Imitation of Christ.\nThe text is divided into four books, which provide detailed spiritual instructions: &quot;Helpful Counsels of the Spiritual Life&quot;, &quot;Directives for the Interior Life&quot;, &quot;On Interior Consolation&quot; and &quot;On the Blessed Sacrament&quot;.\nThe approach taken in the Imitation is characterized by its emphasis on the interior life and withdrawal from the world, as opposed to an active imitation of Christ by other friars. The book places a high level of emphasis on the devotion to the Eucharist as key element of spiritual life.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186691,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8730/?feed=opds","author":"à Kempis Thomas","isOwn":false},{"category":["B","Classical literature","GITenberg","Immortality (Philosophy) -- Early works to 1800","PA"],"updated":"2016-08-09T19:35:08","language":"en","title":"Phaedo","issued":"1999","summary":"There is a well-known saying that the whole of Western Philosophy is footnotes of Plato.

They are Voortrekkers who take part in the Great Trek whom Quatermain has to rescue.\nThe novel describes Quatermain's involvement in the Sixth Xhosa War of 1835 and Weenen massacre. Real life people such as Piet Retief, Thomas Halstead, and the Zulu chief Dingane appear as characters. Events in Nada the Lily are frequently referred to.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186719,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/8826/?feed=opds","author":"H.

Marcas","issued":"2005","summary":"Z. Marcas is a novelette by French author Honoré de Balzac first published in 1840. Set in contemporary Paris, it describes the rise and fall of a brilliant political strategist who is abandoned by the politicians he helps into power. Destitute and forgotten, he befriends a pair of students who live next door to him in a boarding-house. The story follows their many discussions about the political situation in France.\nBalzac was inspired to write the story after he spotted the name &quot;Z. Marcas&quot; on a sign for a tailor's shop in Paris. It was published in July 1840, in the Revue Parisienne, a magazine he had founded that year. One year later it appeared in a collection from various authors under the title La Mort d'un ambitieux (&quot;The Death of an Ambitious Man&quot;). Balzac later placed it in the Scènes de la vie politique section of his vast novel sequence La Comédie humaine.\nAlthough Z. Marcas features characters from other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism – both hallmarks of Balzac's style – it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership had led to mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France were in danger of being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come.\nThe story also explores Balzac's conviction that a person's name is a powerful indicator of his or her destiny, an idea he drew from the work of Laurence Sterne. The title character, with his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself: a visionary genius who fails to achieve his true potential because of less talented individuals with more social power.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186880,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/9220/?feed=opds","author":"Honoré de Balzac","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Heroes -- Fiction","Historical fiction","PQ","Russia -- History -- Alexander II, 1855-1881 -- Fiction","Tatars -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-11T16:21:40","language":"en","title":"Michael Strogoff; Or, The Courier of the Czar","issued":"1999","summary":"Michael Strogoff: The Courier of the Czar (French: Michel Strogoff) is a novel written by Jules Verne in 1876.

Davidow wrote, &quot;Jules Verne has written no better book than this, in fact it is deservedly ranked as one of the most thrilling tales ever written.&quot; Unlike some of Verne's other novels, it is not science fiction, but a scientific phenomenon (Leidenfrost effect) is a plot device. The book was later adapted to a play, by Verne himself and Adolphe d'Ennery. Incidental music to the play was written by Alexandre Artus in 1880.

It was his only novel, but was nonetheless very successful. This satire includes the famous line &quot;Death cancels all engagements&quot; and presents a corrosive view of Edwardian Oxford.\nIn 1998, the Modern Library ranked Zuleika Dobson 59th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.\nThe book largely employs a third-person narrator limited to the character of Zuleika (pronounced &quot;Zu-lee-ka&quot;, not &quot;Zu-like-a&quot;), then shifting to that of the Duke, then halfway through the novel suddenly becoming a first-person narrator who claims inspiration from the Greek Muse Clio, with his all-seeing narrative perspective provided by Zeus. This allows the narrator to also see the ghosts of notable historical visitors to Oxford, who are present but otherwise invisible to the human characters at certain times in the novel, adding an element of the supernatural.\nDr Robert Mighall in his Afterword to the New Centenary Edition of Zuleika (Collector's Library, 2011), writes: &quot;Zuleika is of the future.... [Beerbohm] anticipates an all-too-familiar feature of the contemporary scene: the D-list talent afforded A-list media attention.&quot;\nBeerbohm began writing the book in 1898, finishing in 1910, with Heinemann publishing it 26 October 1911. He saw it was not as a novel, rather &quot;the work of a leisurely essayist amusing himself with a narrative idea.&quot; Sydney Castle Roberts wrote a parody Zuleika in Cambridge (1941).\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186884,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/9235/?feed=opds","author":"Max Beerbohm, Sir","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","GITenberg","PS","Western stories"],"updated":"2016-08-11T16:24:12","language":"en","title":"The Vision Splendid","issued":"1999","summary":"","id":186885,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/9238/?feed=opds","author":"William MacLeod Raine","isOwn":false},{"category":["American poetry","GITenberg","PS"],"updated":"2016-08-11T16:25:17","language":"en","title":"Songs, Merry and Sad","issued":"1999","summary":"","id":186886,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/9241/?feed=opds","author":"John Charles McNeill","isOwn":false},{"category":["Detective and mystery stories","Fiction","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-11T16:25:19","language":"en","title":"The Yellow Crayon","issued":"1999","summary":"","id":186887,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/9244/?feed=opds","author":"E.

Rider Haggard. Narrated in the first person by Thomas Wingfield, an Englishman whose adventures include having his mother murdered, a brush with the Spanish Inquisition, shipwreck, and slavery. Eventually, Thomas unwillingly joins a Spanish expedition to New Spain, and the novel tells the fictionalized story of the first interactions between the natives and European explorers. This includes a number of misunderstandings, prejudice on the part of the Spaniards, and ultimately open war.\nDuring the course of the story, Thomas meets and marries the daughter of the native king (from whom the novel takes its title) and settles into life in Mexico. The war destroys his native family, and eventually Thomas gets revenge on the antagonist and returns to England.\nWhile in Mexico in 1891 researching for the book Haggard received news that his only son had died, which dealt him a lasting blow and badly affected his health. Haggard himself recognised that Montezuma's Daughter was the last of his best work &quot;for the rest was repetition so far as fiction was concerned&quot;. Like many Victorian adventure novels, this one sometimes treats the natives as naïve and barbaric, a flaw Haggard explicitly points out in his main character.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186888,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/9247/?feed=opds","author":"H.

The title is also the name of a country, supposedly discovered by the protagonist. In the novel, it is not revealed where Erewhon is, but it is clear that it is a fictional country. Butler meant the title to be read as &quot;nowhere&quot; backwards even though the letters &quot;h&quot; and &quot;w&quot; are transposed, as it would have been pronounced in his day (and still is in some dialects of English). The book is a satire on Victorian society.\nThe first few chapters of the novel dealing with the discovery of Erewhon are in fact based on Butler's own experiences in New Zealand where, as a young man, he worked as a sheep farmer on Mesopotamia Station for about four years (1860–64), and explored parts of the interior of the South Island and which he wrote about in his A First Year in Canterbury Settlement (1863).\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":186938,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/9415/?feed=opds","author":"Samuel Butler","isOwn":false},{"category":["Cowboys -- Fiction","GITenberg","Montana -- Fiction","PS","Western stories"],"updated":"2016-08-11T16:59:12","language":"en","title":"Her Prairie Knight","issued":"1999","summary":"A debutante hailing from an aristocratic family in the Northeastern United States, Beatrice Lansell fills her days with coquetry, leisure and meaningless flirtations, but she has never found true love.

It became a best-selling American novel, surpassing Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852) in sales. The book also inspired other novels with biblical settings and was adapted for the stage and motion picture productions. Ben-Hur remained at the top of the bestseller lists until the publication of Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind (1936). The 1959 MGM film adaptation of Ben-Hur was seen by tens of millions and won eleven Academy Awards in 1960, after which the book's sales increased and it surpassed Gone with the Wind. The novel was blessed by Pope Leo XIII, the first work of fiction to be so honored. The success of the novel and its stage and film adaptations also helped it to become a popular cultural icon that was used to promote numerous commercial products.\nThe story recounts in descriptive detail the adventures of Judah Ben-Hur, a fictional Jewish prince from Jerusalem who is enslaved by the Romans at the beginning of the 1st century and becomes a charioteer and a Christian. Running in parallel with Judah's narrative is the unfolding story of Jesus, who comes from the same region and is a similar age. The novel reflects themes of betrayal, conviction, and redemption, with a revenge plot that leads to a story of love and compassion.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":187504,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10105/?feed=opds","author":"Lew Wallace","isOwn":false},{"category":["Bible.

Within a dozen pages, Galsworthy establishes his mastery of compelling narrative and sketches an irresistible plot. Much of his achievement lies in the mixture of pathos and humor that he derives from characters little able to express their feelings. There is much else to admire, from Galsworthy's impressionistic descriptions and eye for detail to the subtle symmetry he creates between his characters, emphasizing the cyclical nature of the story. Published in 1913, the story also holds the fascination of a world about to be transformed by war--one in which a love letter could still be delivered by the hand of a discreet manservant, and the residents of Piccadilly kept their horses stabled close by so that they could gallop down to Richmond for fresh air.","id":187547,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10240/?feed=opds","author":"John Galsworthy","isOwn":false},{"category":["England -- Drama","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-23T16:00:45","language":"en","title":"The Master of Mrs. Chilvers: An Improbable Comedy","issued":"2000","summary":"","id":187548,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10243/?feed=opds","author":"Jerome K.

It was first performed privately at the Blackfriars Theatre, then before a more general audience at The Globe, in 1613–14.\nPublished in 1623, the play is loosely based on events that occurred between about 1508 and 1513. The Duchess was Giovanna d'Aragona, Duchess of Amalfi (d. 1511), whose father, Enrico d'Aragona, Marquis of Gerace, was an illegitimate son of Ferdinand I of Naples. As in the play, she secretly married Antonio Beccadelli di Bologna after the death of her first husband Alfonso I Piccolomini, Duke of Amalfi.\nThe play begins as a love story, with a Duchess who marries beneath her class, and ends as a nightmarish tragedy as her two brothers exact their revenge, destroying themselves in the process. Jacobean drama continued the trend of stage violence and horror set by Elizabethan tragedy, under the influence of Seneca. The complexity of some of its characters, particularly Bosola and the Duchess, plus Webster's poetic language, ensure the play is often considered among the greatest tragedies of English renaissance drama.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":187558,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10276/?feed=opds","author":"John Webster","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Manners and customs -- Fiction","PR","Short stories, English"],"updated":"2016-08-23T16:30:08","language":"en","title":"Sketches in Lavender, Blue and Green","issued":"2000","summary":"","id":187559,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10282/?feed=opds","author":"Jerome K.

The internal battle of personal emotion and duty that Antony experiences, and the dynamics of power and sexuality portrayed by Cleopatra, give the play its dramatic tension.

Inspired by an upheaval in Norwegian politics, as well as the life of one of Ibsen's friends, 'Rosmersholm' was first performed at the National Theatre in Bergen, Norway, in 1887.

Dostoyevsky was in financial difficulty because of his extravagant living and his developing gambling addiction; although he had produced some translations of foreign novels, they had little success, and he decided to write a novel of his own to try to raise funds.\nInspired by the works of Gogol, Pushkin, and Karamzin, as well as English and French authors, Poor Folk is written in the form of letters between the two main characters, Makar Devushkin and Varvara Dobroselova, who are poor second cousins. The novel showcases the life of poor people, their relationship with rich people, and poverty in general, all common themes of literary naturalism. A deep but odd friendship develops between them until Dobroselova loses her interest in literature, and later in communicating with Devushkin after a rich widower Mr. Bykov proposes to her. Devushkin, a prototype of the clerk found in many works of naturalistic literature at that time, retains his sentimental characteristics; Dobroselova abandons art, while Devushkin cannot live without literature.\nContemporary critics lauded Poor Folk for its humanitarian themes. While Vissarion Belinsky dubbed the novel Russia's first &quot;social novel&quot; and Alexander Herzen called it a major socialist work, other critics detected parody and satire. The novel uses a complicated polyphony of voices from different perspectives and narrators. Initially offered by Dostoyevsky to the liberal-leaning magazine Fatherland Notes, the novel was published in the almanac, St. Petersburg Collection, on January 15, 1846. It became a huge success nationwide. Parts of it were translated into German by Wilhelm Wolfsohn and published in an 1846/1847 magazine. The first English translation was provided by Lena Milman in 1894, with an introduction by George Moore, cover art design by Aubrey Beardsley and publication by London's Mathews and Lane.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":187619,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10476/?feed=opds","author":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","isOwn":false},{"category":["English poetry -- 19th century","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-23T17:09:06","language":"en","title":"Legends and Lyrics.

Together with his wife, he traveled across France to Nice. In the autumn of the next year, he visited Genoa, Rome, Florence and other towns of Italy. After staying in Nice for the winter he returned to London by June 1765. Travels through France and Italy is his account of this journey.\nSmollett describes in great detail the natural phenomena, history, social life, economics, diet and morals of the places he visited. Smollett had a lively and pertinacious curiosity, and, as his novels prove, a very quick eye. He foresaw the merits of Cannes, then a small village, as a health-resort, and the possibilities of the Corniche road.\nThe writing is often characterized by spleen, acerbity and quarrelsomeness. Smollett quarrels with innkeepers, postilions and fellow travelers and holds many (though by no means all) foreigners he meets in contempt. He derides the Roman Catholic faith, dueling, petty and proud nobility, such domestic arrangements as the cicisbeo, and many other French and Italian customs.\nLaurence Sterne, who met Smollett in Italy, satirized Smollett's jaundiced attitude in the character of Smelfungus in A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy, which was written in part as an answer to Smollett's book.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":187662,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10509/?feed=opds","author":"T.

Doran. A follow-up to Lad: A Dog, it contains an additional eleven short stories featuring a fictional version of Terhune's real-life rough collie Lad, including the stories of Lad's initial arrival at the &quot;Place&quot;, the death of his mate, and the day of his own death. Most of the stories were originally published in various magazines, and touch on themes of justice and the concepts of right and wrong. Terhune notes that he decided to publish the novel due to numerous letters received in response to the first novel, and the thousands of visitors who came to Sunnybank to visit the real-life Lad's grave. Though he initially intended for Further Adventures of Lad to be the final book of Lad stories, he would eventually publish one more book of stories, Lad of Sunnybank in 1929.\nThe novel was a bestseller and well received by fans of the first novel, as well as new readers. Critics praised the stories as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;entertaining&quot;, finding Lad a &quot;delightful&quot; and desirable dog. A critic for the New York Tribune, however, criticized Terhune's writing style and felt Lad was an unbelievable character, while also still noting that book lovers would enjoy it. It was listed among H.W. Wilson Company's 1922 list of 10,000 books they deemed the &quot;most useful&quot;. Warner Brothers purchased the film rights for Lad: A Dog, Further Adventures of Lad, and Lad of Sunnybank, intending to produce a series of films and possibly a television series. The first film, Lad: A Dog, was released in June 1962 but it was unsuccessful in the box office and the project was dropped. The novel is now a public domain work.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":187727,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10671/?feed=opds","author":"Albert Payson Terhune","isOwn":false},{"category":["Dogs -- Juvenile fiction","GITenberg","PS","PZ"],"updated":"2016-08-24T15:30:19","language":"en","title":"His Dog","issued":"2000","summary":"Albert Payson Terhune, an acclaimed journalist and collie expert, shot to literary fame as the author of a beloved series of tales featuring his own collie, Lad.

Bates and his friend Alfred Russel Wallace set out to obtain new species and new evidence for evolution by natural selection, as well as exotic specimens to sell. He explored thousands of miles of the Amazon and its tributaries, and collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science. His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him to discover Batesian mimicry.\nThe book contains an evenly distributed mixture of natural history, travel, and observation of human societies, including the towns with their Catholic processions. Only the most remarkable discoveries of animals and plants are described, and theories such as evolution and mimicry are barely mentioned. Bates remarks that finding a new species is only the start; he also describes animal behaviour, sometimes in detail, as for the army ants. He constantly relates the wildlife to the people, explaining how the people hunt, what they eat and what they use as medicines. The book is illustrated with drawings by leading artists including E. W. Robinson, Josiah Wood Whymper, Joseph Wolf and Johann Baptist Zwecker.\nOn Bates's return to England, he was encouraged by Charles Darwin to write up his eleven-year stay in the Amazon as a book. The result was widely admired, not least by Darwin; other reviewers sometimes disagreed with the book's support for evolution, but generally enjoyed his account of the journey, scenery, people, and natural history. The book has been reprinted many times, mostly in Bates's own effective abridgement for the second edition, which omitted the more technical descriptions.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":187812,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10818/?feed=opds","author":"Henry Walter Bates","isOwn":false},{"category":["E660","GITenberg","Johnson, Andrew, 1808-1875 -- Impeachment"],"updated":"2016-08-25T09:46:40","language":"en","title":"History of the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, by the House of Representatives, and his trial by the Senate for high crimes and misdemeanors in office, 1868","issued":"2000","summary":"","id":187813,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/10821/?feed=opds","author":"Edmund G.

The book describes Edmund's early years in an exceptionally devout Plymouth Brethren home. His mother, who died early and painfully of breast cancer, was a writer of Christian tracts. His father, Philip Henry Gosse, was an influential, though largely self-taught, invertebrate zoologist and student of marine biology who, after his wife's death, took Edmund to live in Devon. The book focuses on the relationship between a sternly religious father who rejects the new evolutionary theories of his scientific colleague Charles Darwin and the son's gradual coming of age and rejection of his father's fundamentalist religion.\nAs Michael Newton, Lecturer in English, University College London, has written, the book is &quot;a brilliant, and often comic, record of the small diplomacies of home: those indirections, omissions, insincerities, and secrecies that underlie family relationships.&quot; &quot;[B]rilliantly written, and full of gentle wit,&quot; the book is &quot;an unmatched social document, preserving for us whole the experience of childhood in a Protestant sect in the Victorian period....Above all, it is one of our best accounts of adolescence, particularly for those who endured...a religious upbringing.&quot;\nAlthough Edmund Gosse prefaces the book with the claim that the incidents described are sober reality, a modern biography of Philip Henry Gosse by Ann Thwaite presents him not as a repressive tyrant who cruelly scrutinized the state of his son's soul but as a gentle and thoughtful person of &quot;delicacy and inner warmth,&quot; much unlike his son's portrait. Biographer and critic, D. J. Taylor described the latter as &quot;horribly partial&quot; and noted that &quot;the supposedly sequestered, melancholic pattern of [Edmund] Gosse's London and Devonshire childhood is repeatedly proved to have contained great affection, friends, fun and even light reading.&quot;\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":187932,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11106/?feed=opds","author":"Edmund Gosse","isOwn":false},{"category":["BJ","Character","Conduct of life","GITenberg"],"updated":"2016-08-25T18:21:16","language":"en","title":"Character","issued":"2001","summary":"I.

It is also important for its exploration of the socialist themes that interested Morris.\nHis earlier fantasies The House of the Wolfings and The Roots of the Mountains were to some degree historical novels. Like these The Story of the Glittering Plain is set in a world similar to the distant past of northern Europe. Morris would go on to develop the new genre established in this work in such later fantasies as Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair, The Wood Beyond the World, The Well at the World's End, and The Water of the Wondrous Isles.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":187951,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11166/?feed=opds","author":"William Morris","isOwn":false},{"category":["Borneo -- Description and travel","DU","Ethnology -- Oceania","GITenberg","Oceania -- Description and travel","Philippines -- Description and travel"],"updated":"2016-08-25T18:33:21","language":"en","title":"Wanderings among South Sea Savages and in Borneo and the Philippines","issued":"2001","summary":"","id":187952,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11169/?feed=opds","author":"H.

In four-volume editions volume names remain except that Louise de la Vallière and The Man in the Iron Mask move from second and third volumes to third and fourth, with Ten Years Later becoming the second volume.

As Clarence Brant, President of the Robles Land Company, and husband of the rich widow of John Peyton, of the Robles Ranche, mingled with the outgoing audience of the Cosmopolitan Theatre, at San Francisco, he elicited the usual smiling nods and recognition due to his good looks and good fortune. But as he hurriedly slipped through the still lingering winter's rain into the smart coupe that was awaiting him, and gave the order &quot;Home,&quot; the word struck him with a peculiarly ironical significance. His home was a handsome one, and lacked nothing in appointment and comfort, but he had gone to the theatre to evade its hollow loneliness. Nor was it because his wife was not there, for he had a miserable consciousness that her temporary absence had nothing to do with his homelessness. The distraction of the theatre over that dull, vague, but aching sense of loneliness which was daily growing upon him returned with greater vigor.","id":188003,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11325/?feed=opds","author":"Bret Harte","isOwn":false},{"category":["Europe -- Social life and customs -- Fiction","GITenberg","Historical fiction, English","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-25T19:39:23","language":"en","title":"The Historical Nights' Entertainment: First Series","issued":"2001","summary":"","id":188004,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11328/?feed=opds","author":"Rafael Sabatini","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Moscow (Russia) -- Social conditions -- Fiction","PG","Social problems -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-08-25T19:39:42","language":"en","title":"Youth","issued":"2001","summary":"","id":188005,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11331/?feed=opds","author":"Leo Tolstoy, graf","isOwn":false},{"category":["English fiction","GITenberg","PR","Short stories"],"updated":"2016-08-25T19:40:17","language":"en","title":"Villa Rubein, and Other Stories","issued":"2006","summary":"Villa Ruben.

Its importance was recognised in its later revival in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fortieth volume of the celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in January 1972.\nThe World's Desire is the story of the hero Odysseus, mainly referred to as &quot;the Wanderer&quot; for the bulk of the novel. Odysseus returns home to Ithaca after his second, unsung journey. He is hoping to find a &quot;home at peace, wife dear and true and his son worthy of him&quot;. Unfortunately, he does not find any of the three, instead his home is ravaged by a plague and his wife Penelope has been slain. As he grieves, he is visited by an old flame, Helen of Troy, for whom the novel is named. Helen leads him to equip himself with the Bow of Eurytus and embark on his last journey. This is an exhausting journey in which he encounters a Pharaoh who is wed to a murderess beauty, a holy and helpful priest, and his own fate.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":188126,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11676/?feed=opds","author":"Andrew Lang","isOwn":false},{"category":["crime","Criminals -- Biography","GITenberg","HV"],"updated":"2016-08-25T23:32:09","language":"en","title":"Celebrated Crimes (Complete)","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":188127,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11679/?feed=opds","author":"Alexandre Dumas","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adventure stories","Fantasy fiction","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-25T23:32:57","language":"en","title":"The Mahatma and the Hare: A Dream Story","issued":"2006","summary":"","id":188128,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11682/?feed=opds","author":"H.

Rider Haggard, the author of King Solomon's Mines and She.\nThe book was first printed in 1889.\nThe story is set in the Ptolemaic era of Ancient Egyptian history and revolves around the survival of a dynasty bloodline protected by the Priesthood of Isis. The main character Harmachis (the living descendant of the pharaoh's bloodline) is charged by the Priesthood to overthrow the supposed impostor Cleopatra, drive out the Greeks and Romans and restore Egypt to its golden era.\nAs is the case with the majority of Haggard's works, the story draws heavily upon adventure and exotic concepts. The story, told from the point of view of the Egyptian priest Harmachis, is recounted in biblical language, being in the form of papyrus scrolls found in a tomb. Haggard's portrait of Cleopatra is quite stunning, revealing her wit, her treachery, and her overwhelming presence. All of the characters are mixtures of good and evil, and evoke both sympathy and loathing. While much of the material on ancient Egyptian ritual is overdone, the often brilliant dialogue and the fateful interactions between the principal characters make the book quite unforgettable in comparison to Haggard's better known but more conventional adventure novels. The character of Mark Antony, introduced in the later part of the book, is fleeting and lacks importance, though historically it seems that the book has some importance as the references made are based on facts about the romance between Cleopatra and Mark Antony and the fall of both from power. Cleopatra goes unrecognized in most discussions of Haggard—perhaps because of its stilted language.\nBoucher and McComas gave the novel a mixed review, saying that it combined &quot;a not always believable portrait&quot; of its title heroine with a &quot;fascinating, wholly convincing&quot; story line.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":188132,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11697/?feed=opds","author":"H.

Henty. It was published by Blackie and Son Ltd, London. Henty's character, Vincent Wingfield, fights for the Confederate States of America, even though he is against slavery. As suggested by the title, he is primarily with the Army of Northern Virginia. Henty's novel has been cited by some literary historians as an example of British right-wingers' sympathy for the Confederate cause; discussing With Lee in Virginia, Jeffrey Richards cites the book as &quot;significantly pro-Southern&quot;. Henty defends slavery throughout the novel, stating although slavery was capable of &quot;abominable&quot; cruelty under brutal masters, &quot;..taken all in all, the negroes on a well-ordered estate, under kind masters, were probably a happier class of people than the laborers upon any estate in Europe.&quot;  At the novel's end, Henty has the Wingfield family's former slaves return and continue working for their former owners:\n\nThe negroes, however, for the most part remained steadily working on the estate. A few wandered away, but their places were easily filled; for the majority of the freed slaves very soon discovered that their lot was a far harder one than it had been before, and that freedom so suddenly given was a curse rather than a blessing to them. \n\nRichards cites the novel as an example of Henty's belief in the &quot;incapacity&quot; of blacks and notes that With Lee In Virginia argues that &quot;a system of slavery is acceptable so long as the slave owners treat their slaves decently and humanely&quot;.  Nathaniel Cadle claims With Lee in Virginia's plot works to &quot;romanticize and oversimplify the relationship between white Confederate slave owners and their black chattel.&quot;\nThe book has been lauded by the right-wing, Neo-Confederate magazine Southern Partisan, who described With Lee in Virginia as &quot;the sort of book Southern Partisan readers ought to pass on to their own sons.

The volumes contained in the collection were all written within 60 years of the end of the war, which means that most authors had living memory of it and were facing the effects of the war while writing. These firsthand accounts allow the modern reader to more fully understand the culture of both the Union and Confederacy, the politics that governed the escalation and end of the war, the personal experience of life during the Civil War, and the most difficult and polarizing question in the history of the United States: slavery.

The next five books detail the unfolding of the war, under Roman generals Vespasian and Titus, to the death of the last Sicarii.

Jesus says, &quot;I am going back to be crucified again&quot;, which makes Peter go back to Rome and accept martyrdom.\nThe novel Quo Vadis tells of a love that develops between a young Christian woman, Ligia (or Lygia), and Marcus Vinicius, a Roman patrician. It takes place in the city of Rome under the rule of emperor Nero, circa AD 64.\nSienkiewicz studied the Roman Empire extensively prior to writing the novel, with the aim of getting historical details correct. Consequently, several historical figures appear in the book. As a whole, the novel carries an outspoken pro-Christian message.\nPublished in installments in three Polish dailies in 1895, it came out in book form in 1896 and has since been translated into more than 50 languages.

Not that he usually felt this an assumption; it was a firm conviction of his serious nature that he impressed others, as he did himself, with the blended austerity and ennui of deep and exhausted experience. An amalgamation of emotions of uncontaminated young minds and twisted old thinkers. A grave contrast is represented in these pages; it provokes profound thought as reader realizes the great distance they have travelled from early innocence to later cynicism.","id":188350,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11953/?feed=opds","author":"Bret Harte","isOwn":false},{"category":["Africa -- Fiction","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-08-29T20:01:51","language":"en","title":"A Yellow God: An Idol of Africa","issued":"2006","summary":"","id":188351,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/11956/?feed=opds","author":"H.

She was devoted to the Church of England, and much influenced by John Keble, a near neighbour and one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement. Her novels reflected the values and concerns of Anglo-Catholicism. She began writing in 1848, and published during her long life about 100 works, chiefly novels. Her first commercial success, The Heir of Redclyffe (1854), provided the funding to enable the schooner Southern Cross to be put into service on behalf of George Selwyn. Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. She was also editor, for nearly forty years, of a magazine for young ladies, the Monthly Packet. Among the best known of her works are Heartsease; or, The Brother's Wife (1854), The Daisy Chain; or, Aspirations (1856), A History of Christian Names (1863, revised 1884), A Book of Golden Deeds (1864), The Dove in the Eagle's Nest (1866), Life of John Coleridge Patteson: Missionary Bishop of the Melanesian Islands (1873) and Hannah More (1888).","id":189483,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/12731/?feed=opds","author":"Charlotte M.

Rider Haggard (1856–1925), first serialised in The Graphic magazine from October 1886 to January 1887. She is one of the classics of imaginative literature, and one of the best-selling books of all time, with over 100 million copies sold in 44 different languages as of 2013. She was extraordinarily popular upon its release and has never been out of print. According to literary historian Andrew M. Stauffer, &quot;She has always been Rider Haggard's most popular and influential novel, challenged only by King Solomon's Mines in this regard&quot;.\nThe story is a first-person narrative that follows the journey of Horace Holly and his ward Leo Vincey to a lost kingdom in the African interior. There they encounter a primitive race of natives and a mysterious white queen named Ayesha who reigns as the all-powerful &quot;She&quot;, or &quot;She-who-must-be-obeyed&quot;. In this work, Rider Haggard developed the conventions of the Lost World subgenre, which many later authors emulated.\nShe is placed firmly in the imperialist literature of nineteenth-century England, and inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of South Africa and British colonialism. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary conceptions of the late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the fin de siècle.

The two short stories present fictional characters who are supposedly part of Twain's lineage.

They have no relationship to the text of the book. Rather, they use cartoons illustrating the children's poem The House that Jack Built to lampoon the Erie Railroad Ring (the house) and its participants, Jay Gould, John T.

He wrote it during 1870–71 and published in 1872, as a prequel to his first book The Innocents Abroad (1869). This book tells of Twain's adventures prior to his pleasure cruise related in Innocents Abroad.\nRoughing It follows the travels of young Mark Twain through the Wild West during the years 1861–1867. After a brief stint as a Confederate cavalry militiaman (not included in the account), he joined his brother Orion Clemens, who had been appointed Secretary of the Nevada Territory, on a stagecoach journey west. Twain consulted his brother's diary to refresh his memory and borrowed heavily from his active imagination for many stories in the book.\nRoughing It illustrates many of Twain's early adventures, including a visit to Salt Lake City, gold and silver prospecting, real-estate speculation, a journey to the Kingdom of Hawaii, and his beginnings as a writer. This memoir provides examples of Twain's rough-hewn humor, which would become a staple of his writing in such later books as Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), The Adventures of Tom Sawyer(1876), and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889).\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":189580,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/12853/?feed=opds","author":"Mark Twain","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Humorous stories","Mistaken identity -- Fiction","PS","United States -- Social life and customs -- 19th century -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-13T17:59:02","language":"en","title":"The American Claimant","issued":"2004","summary":"The American Claimant is an 1892 novel by American humorist and writer Mark Twain.

In the primary arc, a woman was abused, humiliated and abandoned by her fiancé Jacob Fuller, while she bore his child. The child was born and named Archy Stillman and when he got older, the mother discovered that the child possessed an incredible ability of smell, like a bloodhound. The mother instructed her child, now sixteen, to seek out his biological father, destroy that man’s peace and reputation, hence extract satisfaction for her.\nFive years later in a second arc, at a mining camp in California, Fetlock Jones, a nephew of Sherlock Holmes, killed his master Flint Buckner, a silver-miner, by blowing up his cabin. Since this occurs when Holmes happened to be visiting, Holmes applied his skills to bear upon the case and derived a logically worked conclusion that was proved to be abysmally wrong by Archy Stillman using his sense of smell. This could be seen as yet another piece where Twain tried to prove that life does not quite follow logic.\nThis is a satire by Twain on the mystery novel genre. In the second arc, Sherlock Holmes was depicted in employing &quot;scientific methods&quot; to a ridiculous degree, yet arriving at a completely wrong assessment. On the other hand, the crime was solved with a supernatural ability that no normal human possesses. Yet even that could fail to reveal the whole truth as the final twist of the story indicated.\nFurthermore, Sam Clemens/Mark Twain poked through the &quot;4th wall&quot; and appeared as himself in the middle of the story, supposedly while the story was being serialized, and responded to letters sent in by readers to the newspaper editor. During the exchange, Twain made fun of/self-advertised on some of his other famous short stories.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":189582,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/12859/?feed=opds","author":"Mark Twain","isOwn":false},{"category":["Businessmen -- Fiction","GITenberg","Legislators -- Fiction","Political corruption -- Fiction","Political fiction","PS","Satire","Speculation -- Fiction","Washington (D.C.) -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-13T17:59:24","language":"en","title":"The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today","issued":"2004","summary":"The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today is a novel by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner first published in 1873.

Elijah Warren finds himself the guardian of his brother's children who are rapidly reaching adulthood but haven't had to face the harsh realities of self responsibility due to their father's wealth. Unfortunately now there are a few snags with A. Rodgers Warren's estate and Cap'n Warren decides its best to toughen his wards up and maybe teach them some humility in the process. Returning to his native Cape Cod village after many years of living at sea, Cy Whittaker finds the old homestead no longer the place of his boyhood. So-called &quot;improvements&quot; have been going on in his absence, and he finds it  all sadly changed. The old man adopts the little daughter of a worthless drunkard, with the intent of giving the child an education. A Congressman from the district, years before, had appropriated property belonging to the child, and he, together with the father, fights to regain possession of the child. The sympathy of the village goes out to the father, but Cy Whittaker and Phoebe Dawes, the school teacher, manage to outwit the Congressman and the drunken father, and in the end the old bachelor and the school mistress fall in love with each other.","id":189675,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13144/?feed=opds","author":"Joseph Crosby Lincoln","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adoption -- Fiction","Cape Cod (Mass.) -- Fiction","GITenberg","Man-woman relationships -- Fiction","Massachusetts -- Fiction","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-13T20:15:30","language":"en","title":"Cy Whittaker's Place","issued":"2006","summary":"Returning to his native Cape Cod village after many years of living at sea, Cy Whittaker finds the old homestead no longer the place of his boyhood.

The Well Beloved is one of Hardy's last novels. It was first published in three-part serial form in 1892, and then revised and re-published as a book in 1897, after Hardy's last novel Jude the Obscure (1895). The novel tells the story of the sculptor Jocelyn Pierston's search for the ideal woman, through three generations of a Portland family.\nA cottage housing what is now part of Portland Museum, on the Isle of Portland, founded by Marie Stopes, a friend of Hardy and his wife, was an inspiration for the book. The cottage acted as the home of Avice, the novel's heroine.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":189717,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13273/?feed=opds","author":"Thomas Hardy","isOwn":false},{"category":["English drama","GITenberg","Man-woman relationships -- Drama","PR"],"updated":"2016-09-13T23:08:23","language":"en","title":"Man and Superman: A Comedy and a Philosophy","issued":"2006","summary":"","id":189718,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13276/?feed=opds","author":"Bernard Shaw","isOwn":false},{"category":["Ethics -- China","Philosophy, Chinese","PL"],"updated":"2016-09-13T23:08:42","language":"en","title":"The Analects of Confucius (from the Chinese Classics)","issued":"2002","summary":"","id":189719,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13279/?feed=opds","author":"Confucius","isOwn":false},{"category":["BL","Folklore -- Europe","GITenberg","Mythology","Mythology, Classical"],"updated":"2016-09-13T23:08:51","language":"en","title":"Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable","issued":"2002","summary":"","id":189720,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13282/?feed=opds","author":"Thomas Bulfinch","isOwn":false},{"category":["Antonius, Marcus, 83?-30 B.C. -- Drama","Caesar, Julius -- Drama","Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, -30 B.C. -- Drama","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-09-13T23:09:04","language":"en","title":"Caesar and Cleopatra","issued":"2002","summary":"","id":189721,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13285/?feed=opds","author":"Bernard Shaw","isOwn":false},{"category":["Domestic animals","Plants, Cultivated","QH","Variation (Biology)"],"updated":"2016-09-13T23:10:47","language":"en","title":"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication","issued":"2002","summary":"The object of this work is not to describe all the many races of animals which have been domesticated by man, and of the plants which have been cultivated by him; even if I possessed the requisite knowledge, so gigantic an undertaking would be here superfluous.

He had been trying a long time to get his work into the best magazines, and when he had won the favor of the editors, whose interest he had perhaps had from the beginning, it might be said that they began to accept his work from their consciences, because in its way it was so good that they could not justly refuse it. The particular editor who took Verrian's serial, after it had come back to the author from the editors of the other leading periodicals, was in fact moved mainly by the belief that the story would please the better sort of his readers. These, if they were not so numerous as the worse, he felt had now and then the right to have their pleasure studied. It was a serious story, and it was somewhat bitter, as Verrian himself was, after his struggle to reach the public with work which he knew merited recognition. But the world which does not like people to take themselves too seriously also likes them to take themselves seriously, and the bitterness in Verrian's story proved agreeable to a number of readers unexpectedly great. It intimated a romantic personality in the author, and the world still likes to imagine romantic things of authors. It likes especially to imagine them of novelists, now that there are no longer poets; and when it began to like Verrian's serial, it began to write him all sorts of letters, directly, in care of the editor, and indirectly to the editor, whom they asked about Verrian more than about his story.","id":189754,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13384/?feed=opds","author":"William Dean Howells","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","PS","Women physicians -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-13T23:28:28","language":"en","title":"Dr. Breen's Practice","issued":"2004","summary":"Dr. Breen’s Practice is a novel, one of the earlier works by American author and literary critic William Dean Howells.

An enemy to all advertisement, he has so discreetly held himself withdrawn that one might almost say that he has encouraged, by his silence, many doubtful or unfounded rumours, which in course of time would become even more incorrect. For example, although quite recently his material situation was presented in the gloomiest of lights, while it had really for some time ceased to be precarious, it is nome the less true that during his whole life he has had to labour prodigiously in order to earn a little money to feed and rear his family, to the great detriment of his scientific inquiries; and we cannot but regret that he was not freed from all material cares at least twenty years earlier than was the case.","id":189895,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13756/?feed=opds","author":"Georges Victor Legros","isOwn":false},{"category":["Catherine II, Empress of Russia, 1729-1796 -- Drama","English drama (Comedy)","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-09-14T15:29:53","language":"en","title":"Great Catherine (Whom Glory Still Adores)","issued":"2002","summary":"","id":189896,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13759/?feed=opds","author":"Bernard Shaw","isOwn":false},{"category":["Girls -- Fiction","GITenberg","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-14T15:31:11","language":"en","title":"Missy","issued":"2002","summary":"","id":189897,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13762/?feed=opds","author":"Dana Gatlin","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","PS","Short stories, American"],"updated":"2016-09-15T11:10:09","language":"en","title":"Homespun Tales","issued":"2002","summary":"","id":189901,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13765/?feed=opds","author":"Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin","isOwn":false},{"category":["ML","Music -- Humor"],"updated":"2016-09-15T11:10:12","language":"en","title":"Bluebeard; a musical fantasy","issued":"2002","summary":"","id":189902,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13768/?feed=opds","author":"Kate Douglas Smith Wiggin","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fairy tales","Fairy tales -- Ireland","Folklore -- Ireland","GITenberg","GR","PZ","Tales -- Ireland"],"updated":"2016-09-15T11:10:21","language":"en","title":"The King of Ireland's Son","issued":"2002","summary":"The King of Ireland's Son is a children's novel published in Ireland in 1916 written by Padraic Colum, and illustrated by Willy Pogany. It is the story of the eldest of the King of Ireland's sons, and his adventures winning and then finding Fedelma, the Enchanter's Daughter, who after being won is kidnapped from him by the King of the Land of Mist. It is solidly based in Irish folklore, itself being originally a folktale.\nThis is one of the classics of Irish children's literature, its magical stories winding in and out of each other from the start, when the careless son goes out,\nHis hound at his heel,His hawk on his wrist,A brave steed to carry him whither he list,The blue sky above him,The green grass below him\nand meets an eccentric old man full of harmlessness and duplicity who invites him to a game of chess for whatever stake the winner might like. Characters like Flann, otherwise known as Gilly the Goat-Boy, the proud and heartless Lasarfhiona or Flame-of-Wine, the magical Spae-Woman and the vicious farmer who takes on Flann as a farmhand make this an entrancing, funny and always-remembered story.\nWritten in the years before 1916 in America by Colum, a close friend and colleague of some of those who led the Easter Rising, this was the ultimate calling-up of Irish mythology and legend, and, paired with James Stephens' Irish Fairy Tales, made many happy hours for children curled up before glowing turf fires to read by the light of Tilley lamps in the long winter evenings of the new Ireland.\nAnother evolution from the original folktale was written by Brendan Behan, published in Brendan Behan's Island, 1962, pp. 136–141.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":189903,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/13771/?feed=opds","author":"Padraic Colum","isOwn":false},{"category":["Japan -- Fiction","PZ","Twins -- Juvenile fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-15T11:10:37","language":"en","title":"The Japanese Twins","issued":"2002","summary":"One in a series of stories that introduce a period of history and a geographical location through the adventures of twins.

Using a background of myth and fairy-tale to expand the boundaries of nineteenth-century realist fiction, Collins not only takes a blind person as his central character but also explores the idea of blindness and its implications. His sensitive presentation of the difficulties, disappointments, and occasional delights which follow the recovery of sight by someone blind since infancy is still one of the best accounts in fiction of a problem which continues to intrigue philosophers, psychologists, and the general public, as it has done since it was first discussed by Locke and Berkeley in the eighteenth century.","id":190013,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14113/?feed=opds","author":"Wilkie Collins","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Love stories","New York (State) -- Fiction","PR"],"updated":"2016-09-15T15:32:04","language":"en","title":"Who Cares?

It follows in the tradition of eighteenth-century British deism, and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the Bible. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, it was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807. It was a best-seller in the United States, where it caused a short-lived deistic revival. British audiences, however, fearing increased political radicalism as a result of the French Revolution, received it with more hostility. The Age of Reason presents common deistic arguments; for example, it highlights what Paine saw as corruption of the Christian Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of revelation, leading him to reject miracles and to view the Bible as &quot;an ordinary piece of literature rather than as a divinely inspired text&quot;. It promotes natural religion and argues for the existence of a creator-God.\nMost of Paine's arguments had long been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to a mass audience. The book was also inexpensive, putting it within the reach of a large number of buyers. Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":190117,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14407/?feed=opds","author":"Moncure Daniel Conway (editor)","isOwn":false},{"category":["Domestic fiction","England -- Fiction","English fiction -- 19th century","GITenberg","PR","Trials (Murder) -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:26:32","language":"en","title":"The Trial; Or, More Links of the Daisy Chain","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190118,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14410/?feed=opds","author":"Charlotte M.

The earliest version appeared in 1516, although the poem was not published in its complete form until 1532. Orlando Furioso is a continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo's unfinished romance Orlando Innamorato (&quot;Orlando in Love&quot;, published posthumously in 1495). In its historical setting and characters, it shares some features with the Old French Chanson de Roland of the eleventh century, which tells of the death of Roland.\nOrlando is the Christian knight known in French (and subsequently English) as Roland. The action takes place against the background of the war between Charlemagne's Christian paladins and the Saracen army that has invaded Europe and is attempting to overthrow the Christian empire. The poem is about war and love and the romantic ideal of chivalry. It mixes realism and fantasy, humor and tragedy. The stage is the entire world, plus a trip to the moon. The large cast of characters features Christians and Saracens, soldiers and sorcerers, and fantastic creatures including a gigantic sea monster called the orc and a flying horse called the hippogriff. Many themes are interwoven in its complicated episodic structure, but the most important are the paladin Orlando's unrequited love for the pagan princess Angelica, which drives him mad; the love between the female Christian warrior Bradamante and the Saracen Ruggiero, who are supposed to be the ancestors of Ariosto's patrons, the d'Este family of Ferrara; and the war between Christian and Infidel.\nThe poem is divided into forty-six cantos, each containing a variable number of eight-line stanzas in ottava rima (a rhyme scheme of abababcc). Ottava rima had been used in previous Italian romantic epics, including Luigi Pulci's Morgante and Boiardo's Orlando Innamorato. Ariosto's work is 38,736 lines long in total, making it one of the longest poems in European literature.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":190122,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14422/?feed=opds","author":"Lodovico Ariosto","isOwn":false},{"category":["DC","GITenberg","Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, 1769-1821"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:30:02","language":"en","title":"Complete Project Gutenberg Collection of Memoirs of Napoleon","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":190123,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14425/?feed=opds","author":"Various","isOwn":true},{"category":["Composers -- Hungary -- Correspondence","Liszt, Franz, 1811-1886 -- Correspondence","ML"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:30:43","language":"en","title":"Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 2 from Rome to the End","issued":"2003","summary":"See also: Volume 1: http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3689","id":190124,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14428/?feed=opds","author":"Franz Liszt","isOwn":false},{"category":["Aesthetics","N"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:31:02","language":"en","title":"The Psychology of Beauty","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190125,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14431/?feed=opds","author":"Ethel Puffer Howes","isOwn":false},{"category":["Children's poetry, English","GITenberg","PR","PZ"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:32:27","language":"en","title":"Peacock Pie, a Book of Rhymes","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190126,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14434/?feed=opds","author":"Walter De la Mare","isOwn":false},{"category":["Discoveries in geography -- English","G","GITenberg","Voyages and travels"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:32:45","language":"en","title":"Voyager's Tales","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190127,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14437/?feed=opds","author":"Richard Hakluyt","isOwn":false},{"category":["E201","GITenberg","Monarchy","Political Science","United States -- Politics and government -- 1775-1783"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:33:28","language":"en","title":"Common Sense","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190128,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14440/?feed=opds","author":"Thomas Paine","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Mystery and detective stories","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:35:33","language":"en","title":"The Gates of Chance","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190129,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14446/?feed=opds","author":"Van Tassel Sutphen","isOwn":false},{"category":["American poetry","GITenberg","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:35:43","language":"en","title":"The White Bees","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190130,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14449/?feed=opds","author":"Henry Van Dyke","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Insects","Instinct","QL"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:35:45","language":"en","title":"The Wonders of Instinct: Chapters in the Psychology of Insects","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190131,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14452/?feed=opds","author":"Jean-Henri Fabre","isOwn":false},{"category":["Legends -- Iceland","PT","Swedish poetry -- Translations into English"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:36:21","language":"en","title":"Fridthjof's Saga; a Norse romance","issued":"2003","summary":"Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna (Frithiof's Saga) is a legendary saga from Iceland which in its present form is from ca 1300.

Disraeli was interested in dealing with the horrific conditions in which the majority of England's working classes lived — or, what is generally called the Condition of England question.\nThe book is a roman à thèse, or a novel with a thesis — which was meant to create a furor over the squalor that was plaguing England's working class cities.\nDisraeli's novel was made into a silent film called Sybil in 1921, starring Evelyn Brent and Cowley Wright.\nDisraeli's interest in this subject stemmed from his interest in the Chartist movement, a working-class political reformist movement that sought universal male suffrage and other parliamentary reforms. (Thomas Carlyle sums up the movement in his 1839 book &quot;Chartism.&quot;) Chartism failed as a parliamentary movement (three petitions to Parliament were rejected); however, five of the &quot;Six Points&quot; of Chartism would become a reality within a century of the group's formation.\nChartism demanded:\nUniversal suffrage for men\nSecret Ballot\nRemoval of property requirements for Parliament\nSalaries for Members of Parliament (MPs)\nEqual Electoral districts\nAnnually elected Parliament\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":190133,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14458/?feed=opds","author":"Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","New England -- Fiction","New England -- Politics and government -- Fiction","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:38:21","language":"en","title":"Coniston — Volume 02","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":190134,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14461/?feed=opds","author":"Winston Churchill","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","New England -- Fiction","New England -- Politics and government -- Fiction","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:38:27","language":"en","title":"Coniston — Volume 01","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":190135,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/14464/?feed=opds","author":"Winston Churchill","isOwn":false},{"category":["E151","United States -- History"],"updated":"2016-09-15T17:38:44","language":"en","title":"This Country of Ours","issued":"2003","summary":"This vountry of ours is a classic work featuring details of United States history from settlement through the Woodrow administration.

The central characters are clergyman James Morell, his wife Candida and a youthful poet, Eugene Marchbanks, who tries to win Candida's affections. The play questions Victorian notions of love and marriage, asking what a woman really desires from her husband. The cleric is a Christian Socialist, allowing Shaw—himself a Fabian Socialist—to weave political issues, current at the time, into the story.\nShaw attempted but failed to have a London production of the play put on in the 1890s, but there were two small provincial productions. However, in late 1903 actor Arnold Daly had such a great success with the play that Shaw would write by 1904 that New York was seeing &quot;an outbreak of Candidamania&quot;. The Royal Court Theatre in London performed the play in six matinees in 1904. The same theatre staged several other of Shaw's plays from 1904 to 1907, including further revivals of Candida.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":190403,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15218/?feed=opds","author":"Bernard Shaw","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Italy -- Drama","Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, 1769-1821 -- Drama","PR"],"updated":"2016-09-16T17:10:01","language":"en","title":"The Man of Destiny","issued":"2003","summary":"Arena Stage, Zelda Fichandler presents, 3: &quot;Bedtime Story,&quot; by Sean O'Casey, &quot;Portrait of a Madonna,&quot; by Tennessee Williams, &quot;Man of Destiny,&quot; by George Bernard Shaw, directed by John O'Shaughnessy, setting by Robert Conley, lighting by Leo Gallenstein, costumes by Jane Stanhope.","id":190404,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15221/?feed=opds","author":"Bernard Shaw","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fathers and daughters -- Drama","GITenberg","New York (N.Y.) -- Drama","PS","Young women -- Drama"],"updated":"2016-09-16T17:10:15","language":"en","title":"Anna Christie","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190405,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15224/?feed=opds","author":"Eugene O'Neill","isOwn":false},{"category":["American drama -- 20th century","GITenberg","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-16T17:11:49","language":"en","title":"The First Man","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190406,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15227/?feed=opds","author":"Eugene O'Neill","isOwn":false},{"category":["Children's poetry, American","Children's songs","GITenberg","Nursery rhymes, American","PZ"],"updated":"2016-09-16T17:11:54","language":"en","title":"Little Songs","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190407,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15230/?feed=opds","author":"Eliza Lee Cabot Follen","isOwn":false},{"category":["Cellini, Benvenuto, 1500-1571","NB","Sculptors -- Italy -- Biography"],"updated":"2016-09-16T17:13:01","language":"en","title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","issued":"2003","summary":"Benvenuto Cellini was a celebrated Renaissance sculptor and goldsmith; a passionate craftsman who was admired and resented by the most powerful political and artistic personalities in sixteenth-century Florence, Rome and Paris. He was also a murderer and a braggart, a shameless adventurer who at different times experienced both papal persecution and imprisonment, and the adulation of the royal court. Inn-keepers and prostitutes, kings and cardinals, artists and soldiers rub shoulders in the pages of his notorious autobiography: a vivid portrait of the manners and morals of both the rulers of the day and of their subjects.

It is the follow-up to his 1912 classic Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town. Like that work, it is a sequence of interlocking stories set in one town, but instead of focusing on a small Canadian town in the countryside, it is set in a major American metropolis and its characters are the upper crust of society.\nAlthough currently not as well known as the earlier book, Arcadian Adventures was extremely popular in North America at the time of its publication and for a while was considered the greater success. It was also translated and published by the Bolshevik government soon after the 1917 revolution and it became a bestseller in the Soviet Union.\nThe fourth story in the book features a character that caricatures the religious leader 'Abdu'l-Bahá, who visited Leacock's resident city of Montreal in 1912.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":190591,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15407/?feed=opds","author":"Stephen Leacock","isOwn":false},{"category":["English drama","Fantasy drama","GITenberg","PR"],"updated":"2016-09-19T13:00:43","language":"en","title":"Dear Brutus","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190592,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15410/?feed=opds","author":"J.

Also referred to as Kant's First Critique, it was followed by the Critique of Practical Reason (1788) and the Critique of Judgment (1790). In the preface to the first edition Kant explains what he means by a critique of pure reason: &quot;I do not mean by this a critique of books and systems, but of the faculty of reason in general, in respect of all knowledge after which it may strive independently of all experience.&quot; Dealing with questions concerning the foundations and extent of human knowledge, Kant builds on the work of empiricist philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume, as well as taking into account the theories of rationalist philosophers such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Christian Wolff. Kant expounds new ideas on the nature of space and time, and claims to solve the problem which Hume posed regarding human knowledge of the relation of cause and effect, and to have assessed the ability of the human mind to engage in metaphysics.\nKnowledge independent of experience is referred to by Kant as &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge, while knowledge obtained through experience is termed &quot;a posteriori&quot;. According to Kant, &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge expresses necessary truths. Statements which are necessarily true cannot be negated without becoming false. Examples provided by Kant include the propositions of mathematics, propositions &quot;from the understanding in its quite ordinary employment&quot;, such as &quot;Every alteration must have a cause&quot;, as well as propositions from &quot;natural science (physics)&quot;, such as &quot;in all changes in the material world the quantity of matter remains unchanged&quot;.\nKant believed that he had discovered another attribute of propositions, which allowed him to frame the problem of a priori knowledge in a new way: the distinction between &quot;analytic&quot; and &quot;synthetic&quot; judgments. According to Kant, to say that a sentence is &quot;analytic&quot; is to say that what is stated in the predicate-concept of the sentence is already contained (albeit covertly) in the subject-concept of that sentence. The example he provides is the sentence, &quot;All bodies are extended&quot;, which is &quot;analytic&quot; since the predicate-concept (&quot;extended&quot;) is already contained in — or &quot;thought in&quot; — the subject-concept of the sentence (&quot;bodies&quot;). Kant considered the judgment, &quot;All bodies are heavy&quot; synthetic, since &quot;I do not include in the concept of body in general the predicate 'weight'&quot;. Synthetic judgments therefore add something to a concept, whereas analytic judgments only explain what is already contained in the concept.\nThe distinctive character of &quot;analytic&quot; judgments was therefore that they can be known to be true simply by an analysis of the concepts contained in them — or, alternatively, are true by definition. Prior to Kant, it was thought that all necessary truth had the character of being &quot;analytic&quot;. Kant argued that not all necessary truths are analytic, but that some of them are synthetic. Having explained that the basis of analytic judgments lies in the principle of contradiction, (or the principle of identity), the task he set out to achieve in the Critique of Pure Reason was to explain the grounds of those judgments which are necessary and synthetic — and these he termed &quot;a priori synthetic judgments&quot;.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":190777,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15971/?feed=opds","author":"Immanuel Kant","isOwn":false},{"category":["Boys -- Fiction","GITenberg","PS","Uncles -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-19T15:47:05","language":"en","title":"Helen's Babies","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190778,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15974/?feed=opds","author":"John Habberton","isOwn":false},{"category":["Baptists -- Missions -- Brazil","Brazil -- Description and travel","BV","GITenberg"],"updated":"2016-09-19T15:47:33","language":"en","title":"Brazilian Sketches","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190779,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/15977/?feed=opds","author":"T.

With Zolaesque intensity and relentlessness, Gissing lays bare the economic forces which determine the aspirations and expectations of those born to a life of labour.

It was first published by William Heinemann in London in October 1902. The individual chapters had originally been published in 1890–96 as a series of essays in the British monthly literary magazine, Nineteenth Century.\nWritten partly in response to social Darwinism and in particular to Thomas H. Huxley's Nineteenth Century essay, &quot;The Struggle for Existence&quot;, Kropotkin's book drew on his experiences in scientific expeditions in Siberia to illustrate the phenomenon of cooperation. After examining the evidence of cooperation in nonhuman animals, in pre-feudal societies and medieval cities, and in modern times, he concluded that cooperation and mutual aid are the most important factors in the evolution of species and the ability to survive.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":190834,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16145/?feed=opds","author":"Petr Alekseevich Kropotkin, kniaz","isOwn":false},{"category":["Compost","Organic gardening","SB","Vegetable gardening"],"updated":"2016-09-19T16:20:29","language":"en","title":"Organic Gardener's Composting","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190835,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16148/?feed=opds","author":"Steve Solomon","isOwn":false},{"category":["Catherine II, Empress of Russia, 1729-1796 -- Fiction","GITenberg","PG","Pugachev, Emelian Ivanovich, d. 1775 -- Fiction","Russia -- Armed forces -- Officers -- History -- 18th century -- Fiction","Russia -- History -- Rebellion of Pugachev, 1773-1775 -- Fiction","Russia -- Social life and customs -- 18th century -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-19T16:21:23","language":"en","title":"Marie; a story of Russian love","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190836,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16151/?feed=opds","author":"Aleksandr Sergeevich Pushkin","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","London (England) -- Fiction","PR"],"updated":"2016-09-19T16:21:59","language":"en","title":"Sparrows: The Story of an Unprotected Girl","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":190837,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16154/?feed=opds","author":"Horace W.

Through dialogue, three philosophers named Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes debate the nature of God's existence. Whether or not these names reference specific philosophers, ancient or otherwise, remains a topic of scholarly dispute. While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God's nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity.\nIn the Dialogues, Hume's characters debate a number of arguments for the existence of God, and arguments whose proponents believe through which we may come to know the nature of God. Such topics debated include the argument from design—for which Hume uses a house—and whether there is more suffering or good in the world (argument from evil).\nHume started writing the Dialogues in 1750 but did not complete them until 1776, shortly before his death. They are based partly on Cicero's De Natura Deorum. The Dialogues were published posthumously in 1779, originally with neither the author's nor the publisher's name.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":191113,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16838/?feed=opds","author":"David Hume","isOwn":false},{"category":["Canada -- Fiction","GITenberg","Northwest, Canadian -- Fiction","PS","Western stories"],"updated":"2016-09-20T14:47:13","language":"en","title":"God's Country—And the Woman","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":191114,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16841/?feed=opds","author":"James Oliver Curwood","isOwn":false},{"category":["Cathédrale de Chartres","Civilization, Medieval","DC","Mont-Saint-Michel (Abbey : France)"],"updated":"2016-09-20T14:47:23","language":"en","title":"Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres","issued":"2003","summary":"From the Back Cover: Mont Saint Michel and Chartres is a record not of a literal journey but of a meditative journey across time and space into the medieval imagination. Using the architecture, sculpture, and stained glass of the two locales as a starting point, Adams breathes life into what others might see merely as monuments of a past civilization. With daring and inventive conceits, Adams looks at the ordinary people, places, and events in the context of the social conventions and systems of thought and belief of the thirteenth century, turning the study of history into a kind of theater. As Raymond Carney discusses in his introduction, Adam's freedom from the European traditions of study lends exuberance-and puckish wit-to his writings.","id":191115,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16844/?feed=opds","author":"Henry Adams","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","PS","Temperance -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-20T14:48:45","language":"en","title":"Danger; Or, Wounded in the House of a Friend","issued":"2003","summary":"Better if the evil seed were not sown at all; better if the ground received only good seed into its fertile bosom.

Copyrighted in 1889 and first published in the U.S. by Harper &amp; Bros. in 1890, the book was well-received for its portrayal of social injustice. Considered by many to be his best work, the novel is also considered to be the first novel to portray New York City. Some argue that the novel was the first of three Howells wrote with Socialist and Utopian ideals in mind: The Quality of Mercy in 1892, and An Imperative Duty in 1893. In this novel, although Howells briefly discusses the American Civil War, he primarily deals with issues of post-war &quot;Gilded Age&quot; America, like labor disputes, the rise of the self-made millionaire, the growth of urban America, the influx of immigrants, and other industrial-era problems. Many critics consider A Hazard of New Fortunes to be one of Howells' most important examples of American literary Realism because he portrays a variety of people from different backgrounds.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":191127,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16880/?feed=opds","author":"William Dean Howells","isOwn":false},{"category":["Europe -- Social life and customs -- 19th century -- Fiction","GITenberg","PT"],"updated":"2016-09-20T14:56:38","language":"de","title":"Papa Hamlet","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":191128,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16886/?feed=opds","author":"Bjarne P.

My husband's income was moderate, and we found it necessary to deny ourselves many little articles of ornament and luxury, to the end that there might be no serious abatement in the comforts of life. In furnishing our house, we had been obliged to content ourselves mainly with things useful. Our parlor could boast of nine cane-seat chairs; one high-backed cane-seat rocking chair; a pair of card tables; a pair of ottomans, the covers for which I had worked in worsted; and a few illustrated books upon the card tables. There were no pictures on the walls, nor ornaments on the mantle pieces. For a time after my marriage with Mr. Smith, I did not think much about the plainness of our style of living; but after a while, contracts between my own parlors and those of one or two friends, would take place in my mind; and I often found myself wishing that we could afford a set of candelabras, a pair of china vases, or some choice pieces of Bohemian glass. In fact, I set my heart on something of the kind, though I concealed the weakness from my husband. Time stole on, and one increase after another to our family, kept up the necessity for careful expenditure, and at no time was there money enough in the purse to justify any outlay beyond what the wants of the household required.","id":191149,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/16949/?feed=opds","author":"T.

Over the years newspapers and magazine articles chronicled the fortunes of the Elsey characters: Jeannie outlived all but Bett-Bett.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":191265,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17170/?feed=opds","author":"Jeannie Gunn","isOwn":false},{"category":["BJ","Conduct of life","Crystallography"],"updated":"2016-09-21T17:37:31","language":"en","title":"The Ethics of the Dust","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":191266,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17173/?feed=opds","author":"John Ruskin","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Mounted police -- Fiction","Northwest, Canadian -- Fiction","PS","Royal Canadian Mounted Police -- Fiction","Western stories","Wilderness areas -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-21T17:37:44","language":"en","title":"The Flaming Forest","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":191267,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17176/?feed=opds","author":"James Oliver Curwood","isOwn":false},{"category":["Canada -- Fiction","GITenberg","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-21T17:37:47","language":"en","title":"Flower of the North: A Modern Romance","issued":"2003","summary":"Title; Contents; I; II; III; IV; V; VI; VII; VIII; IX; X; XI; XII; XIII; XIV; XV; XVI; XVII; XVIII; XIX; XX; XXI; XXII; XXIII; XXIV; XXV","id":191268,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17179/?feed=opds","author":"James Oliver Curwood","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adventure stories","Bears -- Fiction","Dogs -- Fiction","Friendship -- Fiction","GITenberg","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-21T17:38:50","language":"en","title":"Nomads of the North: A Story of Romance and Adventure under the Open Stars","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":191269,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17182/?feed=opds","author":"James Oliver Curwood","isOwn":false},{"category":["Athabasca (Alta.) -- Fiction","Athabasca River Valley (Alta.) -- Fiction","GITenberg","Mounted police -- Fiction","PS","Royal North West Mounted Police (Canada) -- Fiction","Western stories"],"updated":"2016-09-21T17:40:22","language":"en","title":"The Valley of Silent Men: A Story of the Three River Country","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":191270,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17188/?feed=opds","author":"James Oliver Curwood","isOwn":false},{"category":["French poetry","GITenberg","Lesbians -- Poetry","PQ"],"updated":"2016-09-21T17:40:27","language":"fr","title":"Les Chansons De Bilitis","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":191271,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17191/?feed=opds","author":"Pierre Louÿs","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","PG","Prostitutes -- Russia -- Fiction","Russia -- Fiction","Russian fiction -- Translations into English"],"updated":"2016-09-21T17:40:53","language":"en","title":"Yama = The Pit, a Novel in Three Parts","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":191272,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17194/?feed=opds","author":"A.

The suburban bushland surroundings quickly became important in Turner's stories. On her 21st birthday, Ethel wrote in her diary, 'Seven L. Aust. – sketched it out.' (24 January 1893)\nIn 1994 the novel was the only book by an Australian author to have been continuously in print for 100 years.\nThe book's original handwritten manuscript is held by the State Library of NSW.

The Tale is a prose parody divided into sections of &quot;digression&quot; and a &quot;tale&quot; of three brothers, each representing one of the main branches of western Christianity. Composed between 1694 and 1697, it was eventually published in 1704. It was long regarded as a satire on religion, and has famously been attacked for that, starting with William Wotton.\nThe &quot;tale&quot; presents a consistent satire of religious excess, while the digressions are a series of parodies of contemporary writing in literature, politics, theology, Biblical exegesis, and medicine. The overarching parody is of enthusiasm, pride, and credulity. At the time it was written, politics and religion were still closely linked in England, and the religious and political aspects of the satire can often hardly be separated. &quot;The work made Swift notorious, and was widely misunderstood, especially by Queen Anne herself who mistook its purpose for profanity.&quot; &quot;It effectively disbarred its author from proper preferment within the church,&quot; but is considered one of Swift's best allegories, even by himself. It was enormously popular, but Swift believed it damaged his prospect of advancement in the Church of England.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":191303,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17287/?feed=opds","author":"Jonathan Swift","isOwn":false},{"category":["Poetry","PQ"],"updated":"2016-09-21T18:41:48","language":"fr","title":"Dans Le Fondu Des Mots: Poésie","issued":"2003","summary":"Text, HTML and MIDI files","id":191304,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17290/?feed=opds","author":"Huguette Bertrand","isOwn":false},{"category":["Christian fiction","GITenberg","PS","Temperance -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-21T18:44:24","language":"en","title":"Ten Nights in a Bar Room","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":191305,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17293/?feed=opds","author":"T.

It is the sweetness of philosophical sorrow which has no kinship with misery or distress. In the strains of the saddest music the soul finds the keenest delight. The same sweet, sorrowful pleasure is felt in the play of the mind about the riddles which it cannot solve. In the presence of the infinite problem of life, the voice of Science is dumb, for Science is the coordinate and corrected expression of human experience, and human experience must stop with the limitations of human life. Man was not present &quot;When the foundations of the Earth were laid, &quot; and beyond the certainty that they were laid in wisdom and power, man can say little about them. Man finds in the economy of nature &quot;no trace of a beginning; no prospect of an end!&quot; He may feel sure, with Hutton, that &quot;time is as long as space is wide.&quot; But he cannot conceive of space as actually without limit, nor can he imagine any limiting conditions. He cannot think of a period before time began, nor of a state in which time shall be no more. The mind fails before the idea of time's eternal continuity. So time becomes to man merely the sequence of the earthly events in which he and his ancestors have taken part. Though the meaning of time, space, existence lies beyond our reach, yet some sort of solution of the infinite problem the human heart demands. We find in life a power for action, limited though this power may be. Life is action, and action is impossible if devoid of motive or hope. It is my purpose here to indicate some part of the answer of Science to the Philosophy of Despair. Direct reply Science has none. We cannot argue against a singer or a poet. The poet sings of what he feels, but Science speaks only of what we know. We feel infinity, but we cannot know it, for to the highest human wisdom the ultimate truths of the universe are no nearer than to the child. Science knows no ultimate truths. These are beyond the reach of man, and all that man knows must be stated in terms of his experience. But as to human experience and conduct, Science has a word to say. Therefore Science can speak of the causes and results of Pessimism. It can touch the practical side of the riddle of life by asking certain questions, the answers to which lie within the province of human experience. Among these are the following: Why is there a &quot;Philosophy of Despair?&quot; Can Despair be wrought into healthful life? In what part of the Universe are you and what are you doing?&quot; (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved).","id":191315,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17317/?feed=opds","author":"David Starr Jordan","isOwn":false},{"category":["California -- Description and travel","F850.5","GITenberg"],"updated":"2016-09-21T18:50:16","language":"en","title":"California and the Californians","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":191316,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17320/?feed=opds","author":"David Starr Jordan","isOwn":false},{"category":["Essays","GITenberg","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-21T18:50:19","language":"en","title":"The Long Ago","issued":"2003","summary":"","id":191317,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17323/?feed=opds","author":"J.

Set during the Mexican-American war, the novel relates a twenty-year homosocial relationship verging on the homoerotic between a sailor and the captain of the boat. But by the end of the novel the sailor is the captain's wife, transforming the story into a story of heterosexual love and passion.\nThe novel was first published serially in a magazine under the title Rose Budd in 1846. When commenting on the novel in the context of other novels about the Mexican-American War, critic Jaime Javier Rodríguez describes the novel as &quot;an obscure work not always found in library stacks [thus it] remains largely unread but it too deserves attention.&quot;\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":191355,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17441/?feed=opds","author":"James

It tells of a magic pudding which, no matter how often it is eaten, always reforms in order to be eaten again. It is owned by three companions who must defend it against Pudding Thieves who want it for themselves.\nThe book is divided into four &quot;slices&quot; instead of chapters. There are many short songs interspersed throughout the text, varying from stories told in rhyme to descriptions of a character's mood or behaviour, and verses of an ongoing sea song.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":191471,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17777/?feed=opds","author":"Norman Lindsay","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Pontiac's Conspiracy, 1763-1765 -- Fiction","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-21T20:40:08","language":"en","title":"Wacousta : a tale of the Pontiac conspiracy — Volume 3","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191472,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17780/?feed=opds","author":"Major (John) Richardson","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Pontiac's Conspiracy, 1763-1765 -- Fiction","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-21T20:40:52","language":"en","title":"Wacousta : a tale of the Pontiac conspiracy (Complete)","issued":"2004","summary":"Wacousta is a novel by John Richardson. Published in 1832, it is sometimes claimed as the first Canadian novel, although in fact it is preceded by Julia Catherine Beckwith's St Ursula's Convent; or, The Nun of Canada (Kingston, 1824). Wacousta is better categorized as the first attempt by a Canadian-born author at historical fiction.\nHowever, it is one of the first novels written by a Canadian-born author about Canada, and, in spite of its overwrought sentimentalism, it has been treated as a seminal work in the development of a Canadian literary sensibility.\nIts themes include prophecy and opposites, such as manliness vs. effeminacy, wilderness/wildness vs. civilization, sensibility vs. compassion and the natural vs. the supernatural among others.\nIn the period of publication, Wacousta was quite popular not only in Canada, but also in the United States. A contemporary novel it competed with was James Fenimore Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans. Where they differ is that Cooper's novel focuses on the efforts of the individual within the whole, but Richardson's novel concerns itself with broader cross-cultural motivations.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":191473,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17783/?feed=opds","author":"Major (John) Richardson","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adventure stories","Automobiles -- Juvenile fiction","Girls -- Societies and clubs -- Juvenile fiction","GITenberg","PS","PZ"],"updated":"2016-09-21T20:41:14","language":"en","title":"The Motor Girls","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191474,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17786/?feed=opds","author":"Margaret Penrose","isOwn":false},{"category":["Divorce -- Fiction","GITenberg","Married women -- Fiction","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-21T20:41:15","language":"en","title":"The Heart of Rachael","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191475,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17789/?feed=opds","author":"Kathleen Thompson Norris","isOwn":false},{"category":["Checkers","Chess","GV"],"updated":"2016-09-21T20:41:38","language":"en","title":"Chess and Checkers : the Way to Mastership","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191476,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17792/?feed=opds","author":"Edward Lasker","isOwn":false},{"category":["Families -- Fiction","Finance, Personal -- Fiction","GITenberg","Marriage -- Fiction","PS"],"updated":"2016-09-21T20:43:51","language":"en","title":"Undertow","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191477,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17795/?feed=opds","author":"Kathleen Thompson Norris","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","Love stories","PR"],"updated":"2016-09-21T20:44:17","language":"en","title":"The Lilac Sunbonnet: A Love Story","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191478,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17798/?feed=opds","author":"S.

It is the natural expression of one who knows that she has taken the most.","id":191523,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17843/?feed=opds","author":"John Kendrick Bangs","isOwn":false},{"category":["French language -- Errors of usage","French language -- Etymology","French language -- Paronyms -- Dictionaries","PC"],"updated":"2016-09-22T17:01:22","language":"fr","title":"Pathologie Verbale, ou Lésions de certains mots dans le cours de l'usage","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191524,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17846/?feed=opds","author":"Emile Littré","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fiction","PQ"],"updated":"2016-09-22T17:02:05","language":"fr","title":"L'Escalier d'Or","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191525,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17849/?feed=opds","author":"Edmond Jaloux","isOwn":false},{"category":["English poetry -- Early modern, 1500-1700","PR"],"updated":"2016-09-22T17:04:10","language":"en","title":"Hudibras, in Three Parts, Written in the Time of the Late Wars","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191526,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17852/?feed=opds","author":"Samuel Butler","isOwn":false},{"category":["Poetry","PQ"],"updated":"2016-09-22T17:04:45","language":"fr","title":"Romanz De L'estoire Dou Graal","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191527,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17855/?feed=opds","author":"de Boron Robert, 13th cent.","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","JK","Presidents -- United States -- Inaugural addresses"],"updated":"2016-09-22T17:15:47","language":"en","title":"U.S. Presidential Inaugural Addresses","issued":"2004","summary":"inagu10m.zip file has each address in a seperate file.","id":191531,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17858/?feed=opds","author":"United States.

It is remarkable as the first published book in which Verne was cautionary and to some degree pessimistic about the development of science and technology.\nAs came out long after the book's publication, it is actually based on a manuscript by Paschal Grousset, a Corsican revolutionary who had participated in the Paris Commune and was at the time living in exile in the USA and London. It was bought by Pierre-Jules Hetzel, the publisher of most of Verne’s books. The attribution of plot elements between Grousset's original text and Verne's work on it has not been completely defined. Later, Verne worked similarly on two more books by Grousset and published them under his name, before the revolutionary finally got a pardon and was able to return to France and resume publication in his own name.\nThe book first appeared in a hasty and poorly done English translation soon after its publication in French – one of the bad translations which are considered to have damaged Verne's reputation in the English-speaking world. W. H. G. Kingston was near death and deeply in debt at the time. His wife, Mrs. A. K. Kingston, who did the translation for him, was certainly otherwise preoccupied than with the accuracy of the text and may have had to rely on outside help. in 2005 a new translation from the French was made by Stanford L. Luce and published by Wesleyan University.\nI. O. Evans in his introduction to his &quot;Fitzroy Edition&quot; of The Begum's Fortune suggested a connection between the creation of artificial satellites in this novel and the publication of The Brick Moon by Edward Everett Hale in 1879.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":191557,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17936/?feed=opds","author":"Jules Verne","isOwn":false},{"category":["Drama","GITenberg","PT"],"updated":"2016-09-22T17:32:50","language":"en","title":"There Are Crimes and Crimes","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191558,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17939/?feed=opds","author":"August Strindberg","isOwn":false},{"category":["Canada -- History -- To 1763 (New France)","F1001","Intendants -- Canada -- Biography","Talon, Jean, comte d'Orsainville, 1625?-1694"],"updated":"2016-09-22T17:33:42","language":"en","title":"The Great Intendant : A Chronicle of Jean Talon in Canada, 1665-1672","issued":"2004","summary":"See also audiobook PG#23721","id":191559,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17942/?feed=opds","author":"Thomas Chapais","isOwn":false},{"category":["Chopin, Frédéric, 1810-1849","Composers -- Biography","ML"],"updated":"2016-09-22T17:34:39","language":"en","title":"Frederick Chopin, as a Man and Musician — Volume 2","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191560,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17945/?feed=opds","author":"Frederick Niecks","isOwn":false},{"category":["Chopin, Frédéric, 1810-1849","Composers -- Biography","GITenberg","ML"],"updated":"2016-09-22T17:34:41","language":"en","title":"Frederick Chopin, as a Man and Musician — Complete","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":191561,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/17948/?feed=opds","author":"Frederick Niecks","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Inheritance and succession -- Fiction","Love stories","PR","Somerset (England) -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-09-22T17:35:43","language":"en","title":"The Belton Estate","issued":"2004","summary":"&quot;The Belton estate (1865) by Anthony Trollope is a fine example of the author's favorite subjects: social and family relationships, inheritance, a young woman faced with the delicate choice of worthy husbands, and a sophisticated portrayal of British Victorian life.

This unusual project was conceived by novelist William Dean Howells and carried out under the direction of Harper's Bazaar editor Elizabeth Jordan, who (like Howells) would write one of the chapters herself. Howells' idea for the novel was to show how an engagement or marriage would affect and be affected by an entire family. The project became somewhat curious for the way the authors' contentious interrelationships mirrored the sometimes dysfunctional family they described in their chapters. Howells had hoped Mark Twain would be one of the authors, but Twain did not participate. Other than Howells himself, Henry James was probably the best-known author to participate. The novel was serialized in Harper's Bazaar in 1907-08 and published as a book by Harpers in late 1908.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":193720,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/18296/?feed=opds","author":"Mary Stewart Cutting","isOwn":false},{"category":["BJ","Conduct of life"],"updated":"2016-10-05T14:03:32","language":"en","title":"On Being Human","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":193721,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/18299/?feed=opds","author":"Woodrow Wilson","isOwn":false},{"category":["Arizona -- Fiction","Frontier and pioneer life -- Fiction","GITenberg","PS","Western stories"],"updated":"2016-10-05T14:03:50","language":"en","title":"The Rainbow Trail","issued":"2004","summary":"This sequel to Zane Grey's enormously popular Riders of the Purple Sage picks up ten years after the events of the previous novel.

In its anti-heroine, Arabella Trefoil, it presents a scathing but ultimately sympathetic portrayal of a woman who has abandoned virtually all scruples in her quest for a husband. Through the eponymous Senator, Trollope offers comments on the irrational aspects of English life.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":193768,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/18446/?feed=opds","author":"Anthony Trollope","isOwn":false},{"category":["Norway -- Juvenile fiction","PR","PZ","Vikings -- Juvenile fiction"],"updated":"2016-10-05T14:42:25","language":"en","title":"Vandrad the Viking; Or, The Feud and the Spell","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":193769,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/18449/?feed=opds","author":"J.

It was first published under this title in 1778, although it had anonymously appeared in 1777 under its original name of The Champion of Virtue, before Samuel Richardson's daughter, Mrs Bridgen, had edited it for her. Apart from typographical errors, the revision was trifling.\nMiss Reeve noted in the 1778 preface that\n\n&quot;This Story is the literary offspring of The Castle of Otranto, written upon the same plan, with a design to unite the most attractive and interesting circumstances of the ancient Romance and modern Novel, at the same time it assumes a character and manner of its own, that differs from both; it is distinguished by the appellation of a Gothic Story, being a picture of Gothic times and manners.&quot;\n\nOriginally Miss Reeve presented the story, as Walpole had done before her, as an old manuscript she had merely discovered and transcribed. Under Mrs Bridgen's auspices this fiction was removed from the preface, but more subtle textual references to its authenticity were allowed to remain. These included the claim that the four-year interval was a lacuna in the manuscript, where the original author was suppose to have left off and a &quot;more modern hand&quot; continued the manuscript; there are many subsequent breaches in the narrative where the original was supposed to have been defaced by damp.\n\nThe Oxford World's Classics edition notes that it was a major influence in the development of Gothic fiction. It was dramatized in 1799 as Edmond, Orphan of the Castle.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":198397,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/20513/?feed=opds","author":"Clara Reeve","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","JN","Women -- Suffrage","Women -- Suffrage -- Great Britain","Women's rights -- Great Britain"],"updated":"2016-11-10T11:36:48","language":"en","title":"The Unexpurgated Case Against Woman Suffrage","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":198398,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/20516/?feed=opds","author":"Almroth Wright","isOwn":false},{"category":["English poetry","PR"],"updated":"2016-11-10T11:37:17","language":"en","title":"Inebriety and The Candidate","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":198399,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/20519/?feed=opds","author":"George Crabbe","isOwn":false},{"category":["Finnish poetry -- Translations into English","GITenberg","PH"],"updated":"2016-11-10T11:38:10","language":"en","title":"Kalevala : the Epic Poem of Finland — Volume 01","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":198400,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/20522/?feed=opds","author":"","isOwn":false},{"category":["Aunts -- Fiction","GITenberg","PS","Southern States -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-11-10T11:39:19","language":"en","title":"Miss Minerva and William Green Hill","issued":"2004","summary":"What a wonderful funny book about a little boy growing up in Tennessee.

It deals with the lives of two very different sisters, Constance and Sophia Baines, following their stories from their youth, working in their mother's draper's shop, into old age. It is generally regarded as one of Bennett's finest works. It covers a period of about 70 years from roughly 1840 to 1905, and is set in Burslem and Paris.\nBennett was initially inspired to write the book by a chance encounter in a Parisian restaurant. In the introduction to the book, he says\n\n...an old woman came into the restaurant to\ndine. She was fat, shapeless, ugly, and grotesque. She had a ridiculous voice, and ridiculous gestures. It was easy to see that she lived alone, and that in the long lapse of years she had developed the kind of peculiarity which induces guffaws among the thoughtless.\n\nand\n\nI reflected, concerning the grotesque diner: &quot;This woman was once\nyoung, slim, perhaps beautiful; certainly free from these ridiculous mannerisms. Very probably she is unconscious of her singularities. Her case is a tragedy. One ought to be able to make a heartrending novel out of the history of a woman such as she.&quot; Every stout, ageing woman is not grotesque—far from it!—but there is an extreme pathos in the mere fact that every stout ageing woman was once a young girl with the unique charm of youth in her form and movements and in her mind. And the fact that the change from the young girl to the stout ageing woman is made up of an infinite number of infinitesimal changes, each unperceived by her, only intensifies the pathos.\n\nBennett also found inspiration in Maupassant's novel Une Vie.

The book was written as a series of letters to Moritz's friend at home and is in two equal parts, the first in London, the second walking about.\nThe first edition was published in Germany in 1783 with a second improved edition in 1785. In 1795 an English translation of the second edition was published as Travels, chiefly on Foot, through several parts of England in 1782, described in Letters to a Friend. It contained many errors and was attributed to the daughter of Charles Godfrey Woide (1725–1790), who himself is described in Chapter 5 &quot;Information and entertainment&quot;. Despite its flaws, it became the standard translation of the 19th and early 20th centuries. A new translation was published in 1965 by Reginald Nettel and is now the standard English edition.\nIn deciding to complete his journey on foot, Moritz was met with a rude reception. The Inclosure Acts had forced Englands peasants to become employees of land-owners, and those who could not find employment became the &quot;wandering poor&quot; – thus anyone seen walking along the road was identified as a beggar or a thief. For this reason, Moritz experienced considerable problems finding room and board, and was even run out of some villages, simply for arriving into town on foot.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":198450,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/20675/?feed=opds","author":"Karl Philipp Moritz","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Northwest, Canadian -- Fiction","PS"],"updated":"2016-11-10T13:19:22","language":"en","title":"The Maid of the Whispering Hills","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":198451,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/20681/?feed=opds","author":"Vingie E.

K. Chesterton. The title refers to a more worldly and rationalist worldview, represented by a ball or sphere, and the cross representing Christianity. The first chapters of the book were serialized from 1905 to 1906 with the completed work published in 1909. The novel's beginning involves debates about rationalism and religion between a Professor Lucifer and a monk named Michael. A part of this section was quoted in Pope John Paul I's Illustrissimi letter to G. K. Chesterton. Much of the rest of the book concerns the dueling, figurative and somewhat more literal, of a Jacobite Catholic named Maclan and an atheist Socialist named Turnbull. Lynette Hunter has argued that the novel is more sympathetic to Maclan, but does indicate Maclan is also presented as in some ways too extreme. Turnbull, as well, is presented in a sympathetic light: both duelists are ready to fight for and die for their antagonistic opinions and, in doing so, develop a certain partnership that evolves into a friendship. The real antagonist is the world outside, which desperately tries to prevent from happening a duel over &quot;mere religion&quot; (a subject both duelists judge of utmost importance).\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":198463,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/20717/?feed=opds","author":"G.

K. Loring. It was the first volume in the six-volume Ragged Dick Series and became Alger's best-selling work. The tale follows a poor bootblack's rise to middle-class respectability in 19th-century New York City. It had a favorable reception. Student and Schoolmate reported their readers were delighted with the first installment, and Putnam's Magazine thought boys would love the novel. One modern scholar considers the story a &quot;puerile fantasy&quot; about class assimilation. The plot and theme were repeated in Alger's subsequent novels and became the subject of parodies and satires.\nRagged Dick and Alger's Silas Snobden's Office Boy inspired the musical comedy Shine! in 1982.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":198538,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/20963/?feed=opds","author":"Horatio Alger","isOwn":false},{"category":["Abduction -- Fiction","Americans -- Europe -- Fiction","GITenberg","Love stories","PS"],"updated":"2016-11-10T15:30:10","language":"en","title":"Castle Craneycrow","issued":"2004","summary":"It was characteristic of Mr. Philip Quentin that he first lectured his servant on the superiority of mind over matter and then took him cheerfully by the throat and threw him into a far corner of the room.

This book continues his work in producing evidence for his theory of natural selection. As it was one of his last books, followed only by the publication of The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, he was assisted by his son Francis in conducting the necessary experiments and preparing the manuscript. The Power of Movement in Plants was published 6 November 1880, and 1500 copies were quickly sold by publisher John Murray.\nThis book stands at the culmination of a long line of study in plants and is immediately preceded by 'The different forms of flowers on Plants of the same species’ (1877). (See Bibliography for additional publications on plants.) These studies on plants were first evidenced in 'On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects’ (1862), the publication that immediately followed On the Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection.\nHe co-authored this study with his son Francis Darwin (who specialised in botany) and his devotee, George Romanes, who assisted in editing the work. The work was begun in earnest late in 1877, after his work on climbing plants (1875) and insectivorous plants (1875) stimulated his interest in the subject. At times, Darwin despaired of ever finishing the work, as the book outgrew his original expectations:\n&quot;I have written a rather big book—more is the pity—on the movements of plants, and I am now just beginning to go over the MS. for the second time, which is a horrid bore.&quot;\nAs the book neared completion, he summarised its underlying viewpoint:\n&quot;My MS. relates to the movements of plants, and I think that I have succeeded in showing that all the more important great classes of movements are due to the modification of a kind of movement common to all parts of all plants from their earliest youth.&quot;\nThe work concerns itself with how plants respond to external stimuli and examines these processes in individual plants to gain understanding of some general principles governing their growth and life. This continues Darwin’s work of elucidating how natural selection works and specifically how plants have adapted to differing environments whilst at the same time answering some objections of his day that evolution could not account for changes in behavioural responses. In his conclusions, Darwin presents the key features of plants from an evolutionary perspective indicating that gradual modification of these processes in response to natural selective forces like light and water could enable extensive ability to adapt.\nThe process that creates the circular or elliptical movement of the stem and tips of plants (circumnutation) was identified as a significant one in enabling plants to evolve and adapt to almost any environment on the planet. Darwin also drew attention to the similarities between animals and plants, e.g., sensitivity to touch (thigmotropism), light sensitivity (phototropism), and gravity (geotropism). Darwin used various methods of enquiry: usually setting up rigorous controlled experiments which are clearly explained in the text, reporting the results and then drawing general conclusions. Studies of nyctinasty were particularly burdensome, to Darwin's rest as well as to the plants:\n&quot;I think we have proved that the sleep of plants is to lessen the injury to the leaves from radiation. This has interested me much, and has cost us great labour, as it has been a problem since the time of Linnaeus. But we have killed or badly injured a multitude of plants.&quot;\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":198828,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/21732/?feed=opds","author":"Francis Darwin, Sir","isOwn":false},{"category":["German poetry -- 19th century","PT"],"updated":"2016-11-14T00:03:18","language":"de","title":"Romanzero","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":198829,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/21735/?feed=opds","author":"Heinrich Heine","isOwn":false},{"category":["India -- Fiction","PR"],"updated":"2016-11-14T00:03:26","language":"en","title":"Guns of the Gods: A Story of Yasmini's Youth","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":198830,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/21738/?feed=opds","author":"Talbot Mundy","isOwn":false},{"category":["BT","Deism -- Controversial literature","Jesus Christ -- Resurrection","Woolston, Thomas, 1670-1733.

Castle Richmond was written between 4 August 1859 and 31 March 1860, and was published in three volumes on 10 May 1860. It was his tenth novel. Trollope signed the contract for the novel on 2 August 1859. He received £600, £200 more than the payment for his previous novel, The Bertrams, reflecting his growing popular success.\nCastle Richmond is set in southwestern Ireland at beginning of the Irish famine. Castle Richmond is situated on the banks of the Blackwater River in County Cork. Trollope's work in Ireland from 1841 to 1859 had given him an extensive knowledge of the island, and Richard Mullen has written that &quot;All the principal strands of his life were formed in Ireland.&quot;\nThe unusually (for Trollope) complicated plot features the competition of two Protestant cousins of English origin, Owen Fitzgerald and Herbert Fitzgerald, for the hand of Clara Desmond, the noble but impoverished daughter of the widowed Countess of Desmond, providing the novel's principal dramatic interest. Castle Richmond was the first of several novels by Trollope in which bigamy played an important role.\nThe Irish famine and efforts by authorities to mitigate its effects are the subject of many scenes and the object of abundant commentary throughout. The famine also occasions more explicit religious commentary than is typical in novels by Trollope.\nThe critical reception to the novel was limited but generally favourable. However, Castle Richmond did not sell particularly well.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":199467,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/22613/?feed=opds","author":"Anthony Trollope","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Marriage -- Humor","PQ"],"updated":"2016-11-25T13:03:04","language":"en","title":"The Physiology of Marriage, Part 2","issued":"2005","summary":"","id":199468,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/22616/?feed=opds","author":"Honoré de Balzac","isOwn":false},{"category":["Adventure stories","GITenberg","PR","Transvaal (South Africa) -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-11-25T13:03:18","language":"en","title":"Jess","issued":"2006","summary":"","id":199469,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/22619/?feed=opds","author":"H.

In 1773, Boswell enticed his English friend Samuel Johnson to accompany him on a tour through the highlands and western islands of Scotland. Johnson was then in his mid sixties and well known for his literary works and his Dictionary. The two travellers set out from Edinburgh and skirted the eastern and northeastern coasts of Scotland, passing through St Andrews, Aberdeen and Inverness. They then passed into the highlands and spent several weeks on various islands in the Hebrides, including Skye, Coll, and Mull. After a visit to Boswell's estate at Auchinleck, the travellers returned to Edinburgh. Johnson published his Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland on 18 January 1775.\nIt was widely read, discussed and criticised, especially for some skeptical remarks Johnson made questioning the authenticity of the Ossian poems, which were then all the rage. After Johnson's death in 1784, Boswell published his Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides. This work was based on a diary Boswell had kept during the 1773 tour and included detailed descriptions of where he and Johnson had gone and what Johnson had said.\nThe Journal served as a teaser for the longer biography Boswell was preparing for publication, his Life of Samuel Johnson, which would exhibit the same qualities. Boswell's Journal and Johnson's Journey make an interesting study in contrasts. Johnson considers things philosophically and maintains a high level of generality. Boswell's approach is more anecdotal, even gossipy, and succeeds in large part because of Boswell's keen eye and ear for detail. Both accounts are still widely read and admired today.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":199573,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/22928/?feed=opds","author":"James Boswell","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","PT","Short stories, German -- Translations into English"],"updated":"2016-11-25T14:58:35","language":"en","title":"Stories by Foreign Authors: German — Volume 2","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":199574,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/22931/?feed=opds","author":"","isOwn":false},{"category":["Magic -- Fiction","PR","Voyages and travels -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-11-25T14:58:56","language":"en","title":"A Prisoner in Fairyland (The Book That 'Uncle Paul' Wrote)","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":199575,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/22934/?feed=opds","author":"Algernon Blackwood","isOwn":false},{"category":["Conservation of natural resources","GF","Human geography","Nature -- Effect of human beings on","Physical geography"],"updated":"2016-11-25T14:59:34","language":"en","title":"The Earth as Modified by Human Action","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":199576,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/22937/?feed=opds","author":"George P.

Their Foemen, and Their Fellows in Arms","issued":"2004","summary":"The Roots of the Mountains: Wherein is Told Somewhat of the Lives of the Men of Burgdale, Their Friends, Their Neighbors, Their Foemen, and Their Fellows in Arms is a fantasy romance by William Morris, perhaps the first modern fantasy writer to unite an imaginary world with an element of the supernatural, and thus the precursor of much of present-day fantasy literature. It was first published in hardcover by Reeves and Turner in 1889. Its importance in the history of fantasy literature was recognized by its republication by the Newcastle Publishing Company as the nineteenth volume of the Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library in April, 1979.\nAccording to Graham Seaman, &quot;The Roots of the Mountains seems to be the story that inspired the subplot of the Dunedain, wanderers of a fading heroic past defending the frontiers of the Shire against the Orcs, and the loves of Aragorn, Eowyn, Faramir, and Arwen in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.&quot;\nThis work and its predecessor, The House of the Wolfings, are to some degree historical novels, with little or no magic. Morris went on to develop the new genre established in these works in such later fantasies as The Wood Beyond the World, Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair, The Well at the World's End, The Water of the Wondrous Isles and The Sundering Flood.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":200029,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23025/?feed=opds","author":"William Morris","isOwn":false},{"category":["Authors, English -- Early modern, 1500-1700 -- Biography","BR","Bunyan, John, 1628-1688","Christian literature, English","Christian literature, English -- History and criticism","Puritans -- England -- Biography"],"updated":"2016-12-05T18:45:33","language":"en","title":"Works of John Bunyan — Volume 01","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":200030,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23028/?feed=opds","author":"John Bunyan","isOwn":false},{"category":["Authors, English -- Early modern, 1500-1700 -- Biography","BR","Bunyan, John, 1628-1688","Christian literature, English","Christian literature, English -- History and criticism","Puritans -- England -- Biography"],"updated":"2016-12-05T18:47:18","language":"en","title":"Works of John Bunyan — Volume 03","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":200031,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23031/?feed=opds","author":"John Bunyan","isOwn":false},{"category":["Authors, English -- Early modern, 1500-1700 -- Biography","BR","Bunyan, John, 1628-1688","Christian literature, English","Christian literature, English -- History and criticism","Puritans -- England -- Biography"],"updated":"2016-12-05T18:47:26","language":"en","title":"Works of John Bunyan — Volume 02","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":200032,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23034/?feed=opds","author":"John Bunyan","isOwn":false},{"category":["Fantasy fiction","GITenberg","Inventors -- Fiction","PR","Spiritualism -- Fiction","Triangles (Interpersonal relations) -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-12-05T18:47:44","language":"en","title":"Stella Fregelius: A Tale of Three Destinies","issued":"2006","summary":"","id":200033,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23037/?feed=opds","author":"H.

Although published anonymously, its authorship was revealed by the poet George Huddesford in what Burney called a &quot;vile poem.&quot;\nIn this 3-volume epistolary novel, title character Evelina is the unacknowledged, but legitimate daughter of a dissipated English aristocrat, thus raised in rural seclusion until her 17th year. Through a series of humorous events that take place in London and the resort town of Hotwells, near Bristol, Evelina learns to navigate the complex layers of 18th-century society and earn the love of a distinguished nobleman. This sentimental novel, which has notions of sensibility and early romanticism, satirizes the society in which it is set and is a significant precursor to the work of Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth, whose novels explore many of the same issues.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":200036,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23046/?feed=opds","author":"Fanny Burney","isOwn":false},{"category":["Bobbsey Twins (Fictitious characters) -- Juvenile fiction","Brothers and sisters -- Juvenile fiction","GITenberg","PZ","Twins -- Juvenile fiction"],"updated":"2016-12-05T18:50:10","language":"en","title":"The Bobbsey Twins at Snow Lodge","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":200037,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23049/?feed=opds","author":"Laura Lee Hope","isOwn":false},{"category":["Bankers -- Fiction","Georgia -- Fiction","GITenberg","Man-woman relationships -- Fiction","PS","Teachers -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-12-05T18:51:23","language":"en","title":"The Desired Woman","issued":"2004","summary":"Title; Contents; PART I; Chapter I; Chapter II; Chapter III; Chapter IV; Chapter V; Chapter VI; Chapter VII; Chapter VIII; Chapter IX; Chapter X; Chapter XI; Chapter XII; Chapter XIII; Chapter XIV; Chapter XV; Chapter XVI; Chapter XVII; Chapter XVIII; Chapter XIX; Chapter XX; PART II; Chapter I; Chapter II; Chapter III; Chapter IV; Chapter V; Chapter VI; Chapter VII; Chapter VIII; Chapter IX; Chapter X; Chapter XI; Chapter XII; Chapter XIII; Chapter XIV; Chapter XV; Chapter XVI; Chapter XVII; Chapter XVIII; Chapter XIX; Chapter XX; Chapter XXI; Chapter XXII; Chapter XXIII -- Conclusion","id":200038,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23052/?feed=opds","author":"Will N.

On my later examination of this problem I was much surprised, both at its difficulty and scope, and also at the extent to which it had been neglected by teachers. Ever since that time the two questions, How adults should study, and How children should be taught to study, have together been my chief hobby. The following ideas are partly the result of reading; but since there is a meager quantity of literature bearing on this general theme, they are largely the result of observation, experiment, and discussion with my students. Many of the latter will recognize their own contributions in these pages, for I have endeavored to preserve and use every good suggestion that came from them; and I am glad to acknowledge here my indebtedness to them&quot;--Preface.

But when the Trojan Hector kills Achilles' close friend Patroclus, he storms back into battle to take revenge - although knowing this will ensure his won early death. Interwoven with this tragic sequence of events are powerfully moving descriptions of the ebb and flow of battle, of the domestic world inside Troy's besieged city of llium and of the conflicts between the gods on Olympus as they argue over the fate of mortals.-Back cover.","id":200203,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23340/?feed=opds","author":"Homér","isOwn":false},{"category":["Athens (Greece) -- History","DF"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:06:19","language":"en","title":"Athens: Its Rise and Fall, Book III","issued":"2006","summary":"","id":200204,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23343/?feed=opds","author":"Edward Bulwer Lytton Lytton, Baron","isOwn":false},{"category":["Athens (Greece) -- History","DF"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:06:46","language":"en","title":"Athens: Its Rise and Fall, Book II","issued":"2006","summary":"","id":200205,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23346/?feed=opds","author":"Edward Bulwer Lytton Lytton, Baron","isOwn":false},{"category":["Athens (Greece) -- History","DF"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:29:09","language":"en","title":"Athens: Its Rise and Fall, Book IV","issued":"2006","summary":"","id":200206,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23349/?feed=opds","author":"Edward Bulwer Lytton Lytton, Baron","isOwn":false},{"category":["Athens (Greece) -- History","DF"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:29:19","language":"en","title":"Athens: Its Rise and Fall, Book V","issued":"2006","summary":"","id":200207,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23352/?feed=opds","author":"Edward Bulwer Lytton Lytton, Baron","isOwn":false},{"category":["Athens (Greece) -- History","DF","GITenberg"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:29:39","language":"en","title":"Athens: Its Rise and Fall, Complete","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":200208,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23355/?feed=opds","author":"Edward Bulwer Lytton Lytton, Baron","isOwn":false},{"category":["Citizenship -- Problems, exercises, etc.","Conduct of life -- Problems, exercises, etc.","JK","PE","Readers -- Citizenship"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:30:00","language":"en","title":"The True Citizen: How to Become One","issued":"2004","summary":"This book, intended as a supplementary reader for pupils in the seventh and eighth grades of school, has been prepared with a view to meeting a real need of the times. While there are a large number of text-books, and several readers, dealing with citizenship from the political point of view, the higher aspects of citizenship--the moral and ethical--have been seriously overlooked. The authors of this work have searched in vain for something which would serve as an aid to the joint development of the natural faculties and the moral instincts, so as to produce a well-rounded manhood, upon which a higher type of citizenship might be built. The development of character appears, to us, to be of far greater importance, in the preparation of the youth for the discharge of the duties of public life, than is mere political instruction; for only by introducing loftier ethical standards can the grade and quality of our citizenship be raised.","id":200209,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23358/?feed=opds","author":"William Fisher Markwick","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Peasants -- Russia -- Fiction","PG","Russia -- Fiction"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:30:13","language":"en","title":"What Men Live By, and Other Tales","issued":"2004","summary":"&quot;How Much Land Does a Man Require?&quot; (Russian: Много ли человеку земли нужно?, Mnogo li cheloveku zemli nuzhno?) is an 1886 short story by Leo Tolstoy about a man who, in his lust for land, forfeits everything.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA).","id":200210,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23361/?feed=opds","author":"Leo Tolstoy, graf","isOwn":false},{"category":["Crime -- Fiction","Detective and mystery stories","GITenberg","PS"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:31:39","language":"en","title":"Vicky Van","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":200211,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23364/?feed=opds","author":"Carolyn Wells","isOwn":false},{"category":["BX","Fletcher, John, 1729-1785","Methodists -- England -- Biography"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:31:42","language":"en","title":"Fletcher of Madeley","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":200212,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23367/?feed=opds","author":"Margaret Allen","isOwn":false},{"category":["Conduct of life -- Juvenile fiction","Country life -- New York (State) -- Juvenile fiction","GITenberg","Inheritance and succession -- Juvenile fiction","Mothers and sons -- Juvenile fiction","New York (State) -- History -- 19th century -- Juvenile fiction","PZ","Social classes -- Juvenile fiction"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:32:49","language":"en","title":"Herbert Carter's Legacy; Or, the Inventor's Son","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":200213,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23370/?feed=opds","author":"Horatio Alger","isOwn":false},{"category":["GITenberg","Natural history -- Outdoor books","Nature","Nature study","Paris (France) -- Description and travel","QH"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:33:01","language":"en","title":"The Life of the Fields","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":200214,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23373/?feed=opds","author":"Richard Jefferies","isOwn":false},{"category":["Businessmen -- New York (State) -- New York -- Biography","CT","Russell, William Ingraham"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:33:17","language":"en","title":"The Romance and Tragedy of a Widely Known Business Man of New York","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":200215,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23376/?feed=opds","author":"William Ingraham Russell","isOwn":false},{"category":["Lamb, Charles, 1775-1834","PR"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:34:18","language":"en","title":"Charles Lamb: A Memoir","issued":"2004","summary":"","id":200216,"download":"https://unglue.it/download_ebook/23379/?feed=opds","author":"Barry Cornwall","isOwn":true},{"category":["Cowboys -- Juvenile fiction","GITenberg","Orphans -- Juvenile fiction","PZ","Ranches -- Juvenile fiction"],"updated":"2016-12-07T13:34:41","language":"en","title":"Cowboy Dave; Or, The Round-up at Rolling River","issued":"2004","summary":"What was coming seemed to be a thunderous cloud of dust, from the midst of which came strange, shrill sounds, punc-tuated with sharp cries, that did not appear to be altogether human.
